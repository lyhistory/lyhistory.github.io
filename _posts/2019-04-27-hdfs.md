### OVERVIEW
#### keywords
Distributed System: is one in which components located at networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions only by passing messages.
DSM: Distributed Shared Memory
DFS: Distributed File System: operating remote files like local stroage
Distributed transactions

#### key concerns for distributed system:
concurrency control
availability
scalability
reliability and fault tolerrance

#### key concerns for DFS:
naming
cache (writing policy; cache consistency)
semantics (read returns the data due to latest write operation)


### HDFS
HDFS doesn't support random write, files in HDFS are 'write once', and HDFS is optimized for large, streaming reads of files rather than random reads, 

HDFS's write-once-read-many model that relaxes concurrency control requirements, simplifies data coherency, and enables high-throughput access.

#### key features of HDFS
replica
rack-awareness
write-once, read many
computation closer to data (bring program to data)
multi clients supprot (fs shell, java api for spark, flume, hue ...)
