run WordCountTopology in Local Mode and (Local) Cluster Mode
version: 1.2.2
env: vms centos7
example:https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.2.2/examples/storm-starter/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/starter/WordCountTopology.java
# Prerequisites
Download storm

> make sure you have the storm-starter code available on your machine. If you have already downloaded storm from http://storm.apache.org/downloads.html then you will find the storm-starter code under your apache-storm-\<version\>/examples/ directory. Alternatively, Git/GitHub beginners may want to use the following command to download the latest storm-starter code and change to the new directory that contains the downloaded code, but make sure you have the same version of storm running.

first step
```
cd /apache-storm-1.2.2/examples/storm-starter
mvn clean install -DskipTests=true
```
# Local Mode
CMD:
`mvn compile exec:java -Dstorm.topology=org.apache.storm.starter.WordCountTopology`

## fixed: No module named storm and AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'BasicBolt' 
reason: the python script which SplitSentence uses cannot find dependency, and initially I thought the "import storm" simply using 'pip install storm', but it turns out not the one it's using, finally solved by:
Download https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-multilang/python/src/main/resources/resources/storm.py
put it into any folder you want,  for example: /apache-storm-1.2.2/examples/storm-starter/multilang/resources/
, you may find another storm.py in /apache-storm-1.2.2/bin/storm.py, but don't use that one, I'm not sure the purpose of it, it doesn't contain BasicBolt

then change the main function to:
```java
 public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    SplitSentence pythonSplit = new SplitSentence();
    Map env = new HashMap();
    env.put("PYTHONPATH", "/apache-storm-1.2.2/examples/storm-starter/multilang/resources/");
    pythonSplit.setEnv(env);

    TopologyBuilder builder = new TopologyBuilder();

    builder.setSpout("spout", new RandomSentenceSpout(), 5);

    builder.setBolt("split",pythonSplit, 8).shuffleGrouping("spout");
    builder.setBolt("count", new WordCount(), 12).fieldsGrouping("split", new Fields("word"));

    Config conf = new Config();
    conf.setDebug(true);

    if (args != null && args.length > 0) {
      conf.setNumWorkers(3);

      StormSubmitter.submitTopologyWithProgressBar(args[0], conf, builder.createTopology());
    }
    else {
      conf.setMaxTaskParallelism(3);

      LocalCluster cluster = new LocalCluster();
      cluster.submitTopology("word-count", conf, builder.createTopology());

      Thread.sleep(600000);

      cluster.shutdown();
    }
  }
```
basically we just need to set python path point to the folder of 'storm.py'
I've also changed Thread.sleep(10000) 10sec to 10mins, because I find the localcluster auto terminated before spout and bolt starting, I guess  that's because I tested it using virtualbox, so the cluster startup very slow.
# (Local) Cluster Mode
config:
/apache-storm-1.2.2/conf/storm.yaml
```
storm.local.dir: "storm-local"
storm.log4j2.conf.dir: "log4j2"
storm.zookeeper.servers:
 - "localhost"
storm.zookeeper.port: 2181
storm.zookeeper.root: "/storm"

storm.zookeeper.retry.interval: 1000

nimbus.seeds: ["localhost"]
ui.host: 0.0.0.0

```
then run::
```
storm dev-zookeeper 
storm nimbus
storm supervisor
storm ui
```

open storm ui portal and click on the port number to debug, obviously the full link of it isn't correct, so I just extract the relative path and check it manually
![](/content/images/post/20190517/storm2.png)
check the log content
vim /apache-storm-1.2.2/logs/workers-artifacts/wordcount-1-1558059690/6702/worker.log
then I found an exception ::Error on initialization of server mk-worker
## fixed: Error on initialization of server mk-worker
folder permission error for storm.local.dir: "storm-local"
solved by
`chmod 777 /apache-storm-1.2.2/storm-local/`
