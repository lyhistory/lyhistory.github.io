# 1.Underlying concepts and principles
What is?
BPM is a means to identify, study, change, and monitor business processes. and often used reference to a type of workflow technology used to automate business processes

BPI - Business Process Improvement - generic term for the techniques and methods to change existing business processes

BPR - Business Process Re-engineering - a specific methodology to bring about radical change to a firm's existing business processes

Business Analyst - generic term for the consultant(internal or external) who will undertake much of the information gathering and take this through to change recommendations.

Role of ECM&BPM
ECM is principally about "unstructured" information, encompasses the strategies, methods, and tools used to capture, manage, store, preserve and deliver content and documents related to key organizational processes.

BPM as a Practice
1.Why

reduce costs; reduce time to complete processes

improve customer/partner/employee satisfaction; grow revenues

explore new markets or exploit new strategic opportunities;

times have changed

2.Ready to do ?

think in terms of end to end

do they document their process

open to change? why shall we change?

3.How to change?

a.concept

b.detail - business Analysis ( Plan, Analysis[As-Is], Recommend[To-be]), Process Modeling, BPMN, DPEL

Business Analysis is the process of identifying business needs and finding solutions to business problems

Requirement Planning - assesses what information needs to be gathered and how it will be gathered

Requirement Analysis - specifies and develops requirement

Recommendations - provides context to requirements and functional design work

Process modeling is a description of a business system using a combination of text and graphics

Flowcharting is a more fundamental process

Modeling takes the information from flowcharts to a more detailed level

# 2.Project Initiation and Justification
## Building a Business Case
Objectives:
1.Identify key business scenarios that can be tackled with BPM
2.Determine cost and value categories in your business case
3.Structure a compelling business case for a BPM project

What is a business Case: 
assembles data and analysis to develop viable alternatives to solve a problem
identifies business value in relation to expended resources
two typical approaches: Return on Investment , Cost of Doing Business

Business Benefits and Costs:
1. Identify and define:
Desired business results
Scope and boundaries
Schedule
Team participants
Level of detail required
Decision participants
Decision criteria
2.Typical Business Drivers
Reduce staff and office overhead numbers
Process business critical activities faster
Reduce the number of errors and exceptions
Reduce overall IT costs
Increase visibility into operational efficiencies and bottlenecks
Reduce business risks
Improve customer service and retention
3.Benefits and Costs
Hard:  Faster time to market; Improved process efficiencies; Better customer services; Increased revenues
Soft: Improved business agility; Improved compliancy; Improved morale and retention; Higher brand value
4.Cost Categories For Decision Criteria
Capital: Infrastructure items(hardware/software/operating system licenses)
Operational: Analysis&Design; Implementation&Change Management; Maintenance; Training; Administration&measurement

Build the Business Case for BPM：
1.Eliminate Project Killer
Insufficiently strong cause/effect relationship in process change
Benefits not distributed evenly among value categories
Failure to support primary enterprise strategy
2.Document
ask tough questions
talk to people on the front lines
enlist professional information specialists
use vendor intelligently to support specifics
record evidence
3.Calculate
estimate the total net cost of the project
show how benefits will be realized as well as how benefits will be assessed and evaluated

Example Business Case Outline
1. Executive Summary
2.Problem Description
3.Evaluation Criteria
4.Selection Criteria
5.Preferred Alternative
			Benefits
			Costs
			Assumptions
			Potential Impact
6.Risk Management
			Assessment
			Response
7.Conclusion and Recommendatioins

## BPM as a Project
Objectives:
1.Identify the major project stages for process improvement
2.Articulate the differences and relationship between regular project structures and those focused on process change
3.Estimate level of effort required at each stage in the context of your enterprise, and plan resources accordingly

Assessing and Planning the BPM Project:
1.Initial concept stage
Outline general expectations/known issues/specific processes/tasks
Identify Key stakeholders/key (existing) technology
Outline likely areas of resistance/difficulty/complexity
Be sure to gain a basic understanding of the change problem you are planning fix
2.Create Project Structure
Gain initial business plan sign off
Meet with and communicate proposal to key stakeholders and assemble core team
Agree on formal methods and templates
Create project plan
Agree on milestones
Agree on and obtain seed budget
Identify and formally agree on process ownership
3.The First Deliverable
Project Management Plan
Schedule of Deliverables

Implementing the BPM Project
