A conceptual blueprint that defines the structure and operation of the organization. The intent of an enterprise architecture is to determine how an organization can most effectively achieve its current and future objectives.
Solution Architecture: Construction ICT projects (Information and communication technology) requires thought, analysis and design, the product of which is 'the solution'. Solution can be defined by business requirements(what is needed), project constraints, and available technology options. The overlap of these three influences is the logical solution. Solution Architecture commonly describes the components required for and end-to-end solution, tying together patterns from more than one domain.</p> <p>2).Architecture vs Detailed Design</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Architecture</th> <th>Detailed Design</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Representing High Level Components</td> <td>Representing sufficient details for implementing the system</td></tr> <tr><td>Defines guidelines, standards, policies and constraints</td> <td>Defines methods and tools for implementation and within the architectural decisions made.</td></tr> <tr><td>Address overall system level issues such as physical distribution of components, software qualities</td> <td>Address specific component implementation within the architectural decisions made.</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>3).Responsibilities &amp; Activities</p> <p>Responsibilities: Solution Viability, Leadership&amp;Communication, Project Management(Technical areas)

Operations:</p> <p>Define:
A service -
a logical representation of a repeatable business activity that has a specified outcome;
is self-contained;
may be composed of other services;
is a 'black box' exposed by a 'provider' to 'consumers' of the service
Service orientation is a way of thinking in terms of services and service-based development and the outcomes of services.
Service-Oriented Architecture is an architectural style that supports service orientation.
An approach for building distributed systems that allow tight correlation between the business model and the IT implementation.
Characteristics:
Represents business function as a service;
Shifts focus to application assembly rather than implementation details;
Allows individual software assets to become building blocks that can be reused in developing composite applications representing business processes.

Any business or IT initiative and investment should yield results.The value propositions tries to provide an estimate of benefits that an investment in SOA is likely to yield benefits.
Involves:
Providing an Imperative Analysis;
Understanding what the Return on Investment is.
Understanding the tangible and intangible benefits of SOA.
Evolving 'hot' domains where SOA brings in greatest value.
The value of SOA:
Top-line benefits: Increasing business agility and reducing risk
Bottom-line benefits: Reducing integration expense and increasing asset reuse
Revenue Generation:
Time to Market(Agility)
Improved Service
Extended Value Chain
Cost Saving:
Development and Integration
Maintenance and Support
Operations
Imperative Analysis:
Business Challenges: A business imperative is an organizational challenge of such gravity that failing to change or improve it may imperil the organization.
IT Challenges: IT imperative is a challenge or roadblock that the CIO faces that has detrimental effects on the organization's IT functioning.</p> <p>Translating Business Context to SOA Value
SOA DRIVERS - motivating forces to SOA
used to focus the SOA initiative on spectific areas of business value chain where there is a great potential for an SOA initiative to deliver business results
Achieve better business agility
Achieve greater IT efficiency and productivity
Quickly respond to market and competitive threats
Improve 'time to market' goals
Enhance customer, supplier and partner collaboration.
SOA VALUE DRIVERS - measurable and can be tracked
example: Improve Business Agility
definition: Improve time to market for business initiative that rely on IT Systems.
measurement: Time difference between an established baseline metric based on past projects and services-based projects, based on calendar time elapsed.
SOA VALUE ANALYSIS
It is a technique that maps SOA value drivers to the organization's value chain/key business processes.
Helps in identifying likely businesses and process domains that offer great potential for achieving SOA value
Helps in prioritizing business and process domains

Service Life-cycle Governance
SOA involves the creation of discrete, well-defined services
SOA exposes standalone application functionality at a fine-grained level of granularity, necessitating a new form of governance.

SOA Methodology
known Methodology :
OASIS
SOMA
Top Down or Bottom Up
SOMA
●	It is a method with roles and activities that produce artifacts(workproducts) realting to the identification, specification and realization of services components and flows(processes).
●	SOMA is aimed at enabling target business processes through the identification, specification and realization of business-aligned services that form the SOA foundation.
●	It introduces new and innovative techniques where gaps exist in existing techniques, to specifically address SOA needs. SOMA enables creation of composable services.
●	It creates continuity between the business intent and IT implementation by extending business characteristics(e.g. goals and key performance indicators) into the IT analysis and architectural decisions.
●	Analysis and modeling performed during SOMA is technology and product agnostic, but establishes a context for making technology and product specific decisions in later phases of the lifecycle.
●	Its goal is to provide guidance in the modeling(analysis and design) of SOA.
SOMA activities are grouped into three major steps: Identification, Specification, and Realization Decisions.
At the heart of SOMA is the identification and specification of services, components, and flows.
Each step is carried out by applying one or more complementary techniques.

Even though a lot of people think about web-service when they talk about SOA, you can use MOM to implement it as well (in fact in many cases that's the better option)
Message brokers - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff648849.aspx
Message brokers are one (quite popular) kind of MOM. Another kind of MOM would be brokerless MOM, like ZeroMQ. With broker based MOM, all messages go to one central place: broker, and get distributed from there. Broker less MOM usually allows for peer to peer messaging (but does not exc lude option of central server as well) .
Message Bus - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff647328.aspx
Publish/Subscribe - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649664.aspx
service broker
The service broker is meant to be a registry of services, and stores information about what services are available and who may use them. For example, UDDI which was originally conceived as a web service registry is now considered a SOA Service Broker.</p> <p>https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/java-message-service/9780596802264/ch04.html
Message Oriented Middleware and Queues - Do We Even Need Web Services at All?
http://www.practicingsafetechs.com/TechsV1/MOMs/
in other words,the disadvantage of MOM? OR  compare mom with other middleware like RPC
The primary disadvantage of many message-oriented middleware systems is that they require an extra component in the architecture, the message transfer agent (message broker). As with any system, adding another component can lead to reductions in performance and reliability, and can also make the system as a whole more difficult and expensive to maintain.In addition, many inter-application communications have an intrinsically synchronous aspect, with the sender specifically wanting to wait for a reply to a message before continuing (see real-time computing and near-real-time for extreme cases). Because message-based communication inherently functions asynchronously, it may not fit well in such situations. That said, most MOM systems have facilities to group a request and a response as a single pseudo-synchronous transaction.-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message-oriented_middleware
In which domains are message oriented middleware like AMQP useful?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2388539/in-which-domains-are-message-oriented-middleware-like-amqp-useful</p> <h4 id="_4-5-2-esb"><a href="#_4-5-2-esb" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4.5.2 ESB</h4> <p>An ESB is typically a layer that routes, logs, transforms, and performs other 'technical' (i.e. non-business) functions on messages. It could process messages from a messaging system (such as something JMS-based), or it could work with other types of message (such as SOAP-based web services). In that respect, it's more general than MoM.

Queue Manager vs Message Broker vs Message Bus
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19609705/difference-between-queue-manager-and-message-broker
Message Broker - The message-oriented middleware server that hosts messaging destinations (i.e., queues and topics) for the purposes of asynchronous communication. Sometimes known as a queue manager
Message Queue - A messaging destination that uses a queue data structure to hold messages and is hosted by the message broker. The alternative to a queue is a topic which provides publish/subscribe semantics.
