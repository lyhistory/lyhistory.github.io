宝宝轮滑护具英文教学对话（3岁版）
​场景​：客厅地板铺着软地垫，妈妈蹲在宝宝面前，面前摆着一整套轮滑护具——头盔、护膝、护肘、护掌，还有一双可爱的卡通轮滑鞋。

​Mom: "Hi, my little skater！Today we’re gonna try roller skating—super fun, but first… let’s put on our safety gear! Safety first, okay?" (举起头盔晃了晃)
​Toddler: (眼睛发亮，指着头盔) "Helmet！" (伸手去抓，模仿"头盔"的发音)
​Mom: "Yes, helmet—it’s like a magic hat for your head！It keeps your brain (大脑) safe, just like how your teddy bear’s blanket keeps him cozy." (轻轻把头盔扣在宝宝头上，调整松紧) "Snap, snap！" (按扣声) "All set—your brain is protected now！"

​Mom: "Next, let’s protect your knees (膝盖)—they’re super important for jumping and running later!" (拿起护膝，比划着膝盖位置) "These are knee pads—see the soft padding? It’s like a pillow for your knees!" (帮宝宝套上护膝，粘好魔术贴) "Stick, stick！" (魔术贴粘贴声) "Knee pads on—you’re ready to bounce!"

​Mom: "What about your elbows (手肘)? They’re like knees but on your arms！" (举起护肘，轻轻碰了碰宝宝手肘) "These elbow pads will keep your elbows from getting owies (小伤痛). Let’s put them on… there, snuggly!" (调整护肘位置，确保贴合)

​Mom: "Last but not least—wrist guards！When you fall, you might put your hands down… and these will keep your wrists safe!" (示范用手撑地的动作) "See? Soft and squishy—they’re like superhero gloves!" (帮宝宝戴上护掌，拉上魔术贴) "Zipped up！" (拉链声) "Now you’re a full superhero—ready to roll!"

​Toddler: (晃着小脑袋，摸了摸头盔) "Superhero！" (试着站起来，护膝发出"吱呀"声) "Skate… skate！" (扶着茶几慢慢挪动)
​Mom: "Whoa, slow down, little hero！Let’s practice standing first—feet shoulder-width apart, knees bent… there you go！" (扶着宝宝手臂保持平衡) "Now, push gently with one foot… wow, you moved an inch！" (鼓掌)

​Toddler: (兴奋地滑出两步，差点摔倒但被护具保护) "Haha！Safe！" (扑进妈妈怀里)
​Mom: "See? The safety gear worked—no owies at all！You’re such a brave skater. Let’s go slow, and when you’re ready, we can try gliding (滑行)！" (牵着宝宝的手，慢慢带滑)


Scene 1: Putting on Safety Gear​
​Teacher: "First, wear your helmet, knee pads, and elbow pads."

​Child A: "My helmet feels tight!"

​Teacher: "Good! Tight means it protects your head. Now bend your knees a little."

​Scene 2: Learning the Bending Posture​
​Teacher: "Stand on your skates. Bend your knees like a frog!"

​Child B: "Like this? My knees are bent!"

​Teacher: "Yes! Now lean forward slightly. Never lean back!"

​Child C: "Why not lean back?"

​Teacher: "If you lean back, you fall on your bottom. Ouch!"

​Scene 3: Practicing Safe Falling​
​Teacher: "If you fall, bend forward onto your pads."

​Child D: "Fall forward?"

​Teacher: "Yes! Your knee pads and elbow pads will protect you. It won’t hurt!"

​Child E: "I fell forward! My pads caught me!"

​Scene 4: Balance Drills​
​Teacher: "Roll slowly. Keep your body bent forward!"

​Child F: "I am bending my knees and leaning forward!"

​Teacher: "Perfect! If you wobble, bend lower and hold your knees."

​Scene 5: Safety Rules Review​
​Teacher: "Remember: Always bend forward. Never look up at the sky!"

​Child G: "Why not look up?"

​Teacher: "Looking up makes you lean back. Then... crash! Fall on your back!"

​Child A:​​ "I see ​raindrops​ on the window! They are sliding down."

​Teacher:​​ "Yes! Listen to the sound. The rain ​patters​ on the roof. Pitter-patter, pitter-patter."

​Child B:​​ "The ground is wet! There are ​puddles​ everywhere!"

​Teacher:​​ "Good observation! ​Puddles​ form when water collects on the ground. Avoid stepping in them."

​Child C:​​ "When a raindrop hits a ​puddle, it makes a ​splash​! Splash, splash!"

## BBQ
In the UK, BBQ safety for children is strongly emphasized in early education. Adults always supervise grilling, and children are taught to maintain distance from heat sources. The term "​barbecue​" (or "​BBQ​") is commonly used, but "​grill​" is more specific to the cooking equipment. Skewers are often called "​skewers​" or "​sticks," with bamboo being common for家庭 use due to its affordability, while metal is preferred for durability in schools

Teacher:​​ "Children, today we will have a fun BBQ! First, we must be safe. The ​grill​ is very hot. Never touch it!"

​Child A:​​ "What is on the grill?"

​Teacher:​​ "We are cooking ​chicken skewers, ​beef cubes, and ​vegetable skewers. The ​skewers​ can be ​bamboo​ or ​metal. Metal ones get very hot!"

​Child B:​​ "I see the ​charcoal​! It is black and makes fire."

​Teacher:​​ "Yes! ​Charcoal​ burns to cook food. Only adults handle fire. You must stay away."

​Child C:​​ "Can I help put food on the ​skewer​?"

​Teacher:​​ "Yes! Wash hands first. Thread ​chunks of meat​ and ​bell peppers​ onto the ​skewer. Pointy ends are sharp—be careful!"

​Child D:​​ "The smoke smells good!"

​Teacher:​​ "That is the food cooking. But never lean over the grill. Steam and fire can ​burn​ your skin."

​Child E:​​ "How do we know when the meat is ready?"

​Teacher:​​ "Adults check with a thermometer. Meat must be fully cooked to keep us healthy. Never eat pink meat from the grill."

​Child F:​​ "My skewer is done! Can I eat it now?"

​Teacher:​​ "Wait! Let it cool on the plate. Hot food can burn your mouth. Blow on it gently first."

​Child G:​​ "What if I drop my skewer on the ground?"

​Teacher:​​ "Tell an adult immediately. Do not pick it up—it might be dirty or hot!"

场景教学示例：花园里的“Ladle Game”（长柄勺游戏）
​场景设定​：英国幼儿园的户外花园（有种植区、小水池、玩具厨房），3-4岁宝宝Luna和小伙伴们。

​1. 场景引入：用“问题+示范”激活兴趣​
​Teacher​（举着长柄勺，蹲在种植区旁）: "Look, children！What’s this? It’s a ladle—a long-handled spoon (长柄勺)! See its big bowl? We can use it to scoop (舀) things！Who wants to help me feed the ducks (喂鸭子) today?"（看，孩子们！这是什么？是“长柄勺”——“长柄的勺子”！看它的大勺子！我们可以用它“舀”东西！今天谁想帮我“喂鸭子”？）
​Luna​（踮脚摸勺子）: "Ladle！Scoop ducks！"（长柄勺！舀鸭子！）
​Teacher​（递过小鸭子玩具）: "Great！Let’s pretend the ducks are thirsty. Use the ladle to scoop water from the pond… gently！Don’t spill！"（太棒了！我们假装鸭子渴了。用长柄勺从池塘里舀水…轻轻的！别洒出来！）

### Plants
​Plant Parts:
    Root, stem, leaf, petal, seed, bud, thorn, soil.
    Example: "Touch the ​petals​ gently—they are soft and colorful!"
    Stem（主茎）​​ 就像是植物的“主干道”或“中枢脊柱”。它从根部向上生长，分出枝条，叶片、花朵和果实都长在它上面。它的核心任务是输送水分和养分，并支撑整株植物。比如树的树干（trunk）、玫瑰的主枝，都是典型的 stem。

    ​Stalk（柄）​​ 则更像是连接某个具体“站点”的“专用支路”。它特指支撑叶子、花朵或单个果实的那部分。例如，连接一个苹果和树枝的那根细长的梗，就是 stalk。像玉米、芹菜这类植物，我们食用的部分本身就是它们的 stalk

    当作为动词使用时，这两个词的意思就完全不同了：
    ​To stem​ 主要有两个意思：
    ​起源于、由...造成，通常与介词 from连用（stem from）。例如：The conflict stems from a lack of communication.（冲突源于缺乏沟通。）​阻止、遏制​（某种流动或扩散），例如：stem the bleeding（止血），stem the tide of inflation（遏制通货膨胀的势头）。
    ​To stalk​ 也有两个常见意思，但都与植物无关：
      ​悄悄地跟踪、潜近，通常指捕食者跟踪猎物，或者令人不安地跟踪某人
      ​趾高气扬地走、大步行走，通常带着怒气或高傲的姿态

​Action Verbs:
    Plant, grow, water, observe, smell, collect, protect.
    Example: "Let’s ​water​ the seeds so they can ​grow​!"
​Safety Rules:
    "Look but don’t pick!" (for wildflowers)
    "Thorns are sharp—use gentle hands!" (for roses/cacti)
    "Ask an adult before touching!" (unfamiliar plants

​Mummy Pig: "Stop being so rude! Some plants wear 'danger coats'—they might give tummy-aches!"
​Nurse​ (示范尖刺植物): "Look with eyes, not with fingers! Thorns are like nature's tiny swords."

英国园丁谚语​：
"Nettles sting, poppies sleep—only fools taste what they can't keep."
（荨麻刺人，罂粟催眠，傻子才尝不认识的东西）
​美国童子军守则​：
"Leaves of three? Let it be! Berries white? Run from sight!"
（三片叶？别碰它！白浆果？快跑开！）
