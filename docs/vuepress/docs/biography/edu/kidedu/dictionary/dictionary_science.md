### 磁铁教学对话
​场景​：妈妈和3岁宝宝围坐在地毯上，面前摆着几块小磁铁、回形针、塑料玩具和冰箱贴。

​Mom: "Honey, come here. Look at these shiny little toys—do you know what they’re called? They’re magnets!" (拿起一块磁铁，在宝宝面前晃一晃)
​Toddler: (眼睛发亮) "Mag...net?" (努力模仿发音，手指戳了戳磁铁)
​Mom: "Yes, magnet—say it with Mommy: ‘mag-net’!" (拉着宝宝的小手一起说)
​Toddler: (奶声奶气) "Mag-net!" (咯咯笑)
​Mom: "Wow, so clever！Now, let’s play a game. Can your magnet ‘hold hands’ with this?" (拿起一片回形针，举到磁铁下方)
​Toddler: (好奇地凑近，把磁铁按上去) "Hold hands!" (发现回形针被吸住，兴奋地拍手)
​Mom: "See? The magnet is like a magic friend—it can ‘hug’ metal things, like this paper clip, or the fridge sticker over there!" (指向墙上的冰箱贴)
​Toddler: (指着冰箱贴) "Hug sticker!" (试图把磁铁贴到冰箱上，成功后跳起来)
​Mom: "Bravo！Magnets love metal so much—they just can’t wait to give it a hug. What else can we find to hug today?" (拿出塑料小汽车)
​Toddler: (摇摇头，把塑料车推远) "No hug… car not metal." (又拿起另一块磁铁，和第一块碰了碰) "Clang!" (开心地学声音)
