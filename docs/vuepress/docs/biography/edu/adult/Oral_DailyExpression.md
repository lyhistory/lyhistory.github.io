误：I think I can't.
正：I don't think I can.
提示：汉语里说“我想我不会”的时候，英语里面总是说“我不认为我会”。以后在说类似的英语句子的时候，只要留心，也会习惯英语的表达习惯的。

误：I don't dance well too.
正：I am not a very good dancer either.
提示：当我们说不擅长做什么事情的时候，英语里面通常用not good at something，英语的思维甚至直接跳跃到：我不是一个好的舞者。

误：I have something to do tomorrow.
正：I am tied up all day tomorrow.
提示：用I have something to do来表示很忙，这也完全是中国式的说法。因为每时每刻我们都有事情要做，躺在那里睡大觉也是事情。所以可以说我很忙，脱不开身：I'm tied up。还有其它的说法：I can't make it at that time. I'd love to, but I can't, I have to stay at home.

误：Would you like to join our party on Friday?
正：Would you like to come to our party on Friday night?
提示：join往往是指参加俱乐部或者协会，如：join a health club; join the Communist Party。事实上，常常与party搭配的动词是come 或者go。如go a wild party，或者come to a Christmas Party。

误：I have no experience.
正：I don't know much about that.
提示：I have no experience这句话听起来古里古怪，因为只需要说那方面我懂得不多，或者这方面我不在行，就行了。I am not really an expert in this area。

误：Will you be going back home for the Spring Festival? --Of course!
正：--Sure. / Certainly.
提示：以英语为母语的人使用of course的频率要比中国的学生低得多，只有在回答一些众所周知的问题时才说of course。因为of course后面隐含的一句话是“我当然知道啦！难道我是一个傻瓜吗？”因此，of course带有挑衅的意味。在交谈时，用sure或certainly效果会好得多。同时，of course not也具挑衅的意味。正常情况下语气温和的说法是certainly not。

误：The price is very suitable for me.
正：The price is right.
提示：suitable(合适的、相配的)最常见的用法是以否定的形式出现在告示或通知上，如：下列节目儿童不宜。The following programme is not suitable for children.

#### 时态在母语者大脑中的含义
	Present Simple:
	Present Continous:

	Past Simple tense： tells us a specific past time, time is very important, sometimes you can even guess the time. 明确的时间点yesterday, last weekend, when it was in theaters​ 这样的词
	Present Perfect：talk about experience before now, it has already happened, the time is not important, maybe it's in your life, or maybe recently. 跟时间没关系，只是谈经验
	Present Perpect Continous: means it has already happened/started before now, but it's still happening now.
	Past Perfect: experience before a past time!
	Past perfect continuous: it's like 'had done' and 'am doing' together, at a past time something has already started, but it was still happening at that past time.
	实例：
	A: What did you you do today?
	B: (he used past tense and he said today, he must be talking about in the morning today.) Well I just watched a movie in the morning today.
	A: Oh, have you watched that movie before?
	B: (it's my experience, what time? that's not important, it has already happened..) Yep I have watched that movie about three times.
	A: So that's it...You have been watching movies all day?
	B: (He thinks I'm still watching the movie! I haven't watched the movie for the last two hours! Alright time to use a couple of tenses and make this right!) No no, I watched movies in the morning, but now I have been studying English for the last two hours.
	A: Wow! I see what you did there! You just used two tenses in one sentence! Very impressive!

	A: I love living in China, So have you lived in China before?
	B: (ok, have lived, so present perfect, he's asking about my experience! I could just say yes, but maybe I'll be more specific, and use past tense, so he knows when I lived in China.) Yeah, I lived in China for 10 years, from 2010 to 2020.
	A: (Wow okay, he used past tense, so he's not living in China now! That's why he used past tense! Like we say "When I was a kid" because I'm not a kid now) Wow okay! and had you been to China before that?
	B: (Wow! past perfect tense, so he's asking about my experience before a past time! So the past time is 2010, He's asking about before that) Yeah I had travelled there once before.
	A: So where have you been liviing recently?
	B: (Present perfect continuous, it's from the past to now, and continuing now. Maybe I can use two tenses, both continuous!) Well I've been living in Japan, but now I'm visiting China for a holiday.
	A: Oh I see! So where had you been living before you moved to China in 2010?
	B: (Oh god! Past perfect continuous, it's like 'had done' and 'am doing' together, at a past time something has already started, but it was still happening at that time.) Well I had been living in Australia for most of my life, but I wanted to try something different, so I moved away!

	What did she say?
	What has he said about the project so far?"​​ （他目前对这个项目都发表了什么看法？）
	What did he say in the statement?"​​ （声明里具体说了什么？）-> 关注声明本身的内容。
	What has he said now?"​​ （他现在终于说了什么？）-> 强调声明是刚发生的，并对当前舆论产生了即时影响

	should do VS should be doing（它暗示在当前这个时间点，某个动作按理说应该正在发生，但实际情况可能并非如此，带有一种轻微的建议或纠正意味）
	We should be displaying the settlement price of last Friday” 隐含的意思是：根据规则（比如周一晚上7点前应显示上周五的结算价），​此刻系统屏幕上理应正在展示的是上周五的价格。

	当你和宝宝一起读完某个角色对话框里的文字后，用这个问题非常自然。它帮助宝宝回顾和确认刚刚听到的信息，巩固理解。例如：
	读完小老鼠的话后，可以指着图画问：“We just read the mouse's words. ​What did she say​?”（我们刚刚读了小老鼠的话。​她说了什么​？）
	当画面上角色表情生动、但还没有揭示对话，或者你想鼓励宝宝超越书本内容进行创造时，用这个问题很棒。它引导宝宝根据情景推测角色的语言。例如：
	指着图中哭泣的小羊，可以问：“The little lamb looks so sad. ​What does she say​ to her friend?”（小羊看起来很伤心。她会对她的朋友说些什么呢？）

	Did you have breakfast/lunch/dinner?​​
	Have you had lunch yet?​​ ​“Have you eaten...today?”​​ 这种现在完成时的问法，虽然语法完全正确，但它的“味道”变了。它更侧重于询问从过去到现在一段时间内的经历和状态。当后面接上具体的食物（如 chicken）时，听起来更像是在做一项饮食调查，比如关心对方今天的蛋白质摄入情况，而失去了简单问候的意味

#### 委婉

​​“could”是“can”的过去式，​​“would”是“will”的过去式，而​“should”通常也被视为“shall”的过去式。不过，它们的用法远不止表示过去这么简单，在现代英语中，它们更多地被用作独立的情态动词，来表达各种微妙的语气和意图。

​can → could
1. 过去的能力或可能性
   When I was young, I ​could​ run very fast. 
   He said he ​couldn't​ finish the work on time.
2. 更委婉的请求或推测
   ​Could​ you please pass me the salt? 
3. 虚拟语气
   If I ​could​ fly, I would travel around the world. 
   It ​could​ rain this afternoon. 

will → would​
will和 would的关系是理解英语时态和语气的核心
Will 主要指向未来 表达相对确定、直接的事实或预测
Would 主要指向过去将来​（从过去视角看未来） 表达较不确定、委婉、假设性的情况
To clarify, after confirming with Agnes, the changes would be: xxxx. 它暗示这些变更是“根据Agnes的说法将会是如此”，为信息留下了一丝回旋余地
1. 过去将来的意愿或行动
   She said she ​would​ call me back. 
2. 更委婉的请求或习惯
   Would​ you like a cup of tea?
   When I was a child, I ​would​ often go fishing with my grandfather. (表示过去反复发生的习惯性动作)
3. 虚拟语气
   If I had enough money, I ​would​ buy a house. 

​shall → should
1. 过去将来（较少用）
   I thought we ​should​ wait for them. 
2. 提出建议、表示义务
   ​Shall​ we begin the meeting? 
   You ​should​ see a doctor if you feel unwell. 
3. 虚拟语气
   It's strange that he ​should​ say that. （真奇怪，他居然会那么说。）
#### 同一句话不同意思

“It's gone” 这个表达可能对应 ​​“It is gone”​​ 或 ​​“It has gone”​
	It(主语) + is(系动词) + gone(形容词，作表语) 描述“不见了、消失了”的状态
		I can't find my wallet; ​it's gone​!
	It(主语) + has(助动词) + gone(过去分词，构成完成时) 强调“去、离开”的动作
		The bird ​has gone​ to its nest.


#### 其他

will vs is going to
	be going to ​事先考虑好的、明确的计划或意图
	will 说话时临时决定的意图或主动提出的承诺 
		​临时决定 That sounds great! I ​will​ watch it tonight.
		主动承诺或提供帮助​ I ​will​ help you with your homework.
		对普遍事实或趋势的预测​ She ​will​ be 10 years old next year.


What do you say?​​
​​“你该说什么？”​​ 用于提醒孩子在特定情境下（如收到礼物、得到帮助后）说出合适的礼貌用语。
​How do you say?​​
​​“这个用英语怎么说？”​​ 用于当孩子想知道某个词或某句话用英语如何表达时。

Shapes in the Clouds"​​ 而不是 "Shapes of the Clouds"，主要是为了准确表达“从云朵中看出形状”这个概念
	​​"of" 强调“所属关系”​​：介词 ​​"of"​​ 通常表示一种直接的所属或描述关系。如果使用 "Shapes of the Clouds"，它更倾向于指云朵本身客观的、物理上的形状和分类​（比如气象学上说的积云、层云等），而不是我们主观想象出的图案 
	​​"in" 强调“在其中”​​：介词 ​​"in"​​ 在这里表示这些形状是包含在云朵这个整体之内的，是我们观察和想象出来的图案。这完美契合了“从云朵里看出各种形状”这个充满童趣和想象力的活动
画面感 by walk by / drive by / ​floating by / passing by / ​flying by 
	这里的 "by" 是一个副词，而不是介词。它的核心意思是“经过”或“在旁边”
	We sat on the hill, watching the clouds ​float by. 强调动态的经过
	A piece of wood was ​floating​ on the water. 强调悬浮状态


Bull's-Eye Grocery even paid to put stickers in the urinals, and I'm actually glad they did,because now the floors in the boys bathroom are a  lot less sticky.
	一种常见于男厕小便池内的标靶贴纸。这类贴纸通常设计成目标靶心、足球球门、小苍蝇或其他趣味图案，目的是吸引使用者对准特定位置
作为非母语者搞不清为什么有时候是进行时而不是普通现在时
	But the Platinum High Flyers Club isn't the only nd now thet may the school is trying to make money. They're also selling corporate sponsorships
	现在进行时 (Present Continuous)​​ 描述当前正在发生的动作或现阶段持续的状态
	​一般现在时 (Simple Present)​​ 描述经常性、习惯性的动作或普遍事实
	如果说 “The school ​tries​ to make money”（一般现在时），听起来像是在描述学校的一个常规特性或长期政策，语气相对中性。
	而使用 “The school ​is trying​ to make money”（现在进行时）则强调了“当前”的主动努力，可能隐含了一种“不同于往常”或“值得关注”的意味。
everyone​​ 虽然在意思上指的是“所有的人”，但它在语法形式上是一个单数名词。这决定了它后面的谓语动词要用单数形式（第三人称单数）
	Does everyone ​have​ their ticket?
	虽然这些词谓语用单数，但在指代时（用代词指回它们），现代英语中为了避免性别歧视，更常用“they/their/them”等复数代词（尤其在口语中）。
	有点别扭但语法曾要求​：Everyone should take ​his​ seat. – 传统语法要求用单数代词。
	更自然且现代的用法​：Everyone should take ​their​ seat. 

I noticed you were just falling.”​​ 很有意思，它描述的是一个 ​​“正在发生但尚未完成”​​ 的动作瞬间。对方可能摔倒了，也可能没有最终摔倒，这完全取决于这句话之后的实际情况。
	A: "I noticed you were just falling. Are you okay?" （我刚才看到你要摔倒了。你没事吧？）
	B: "Ouch... Yeah, I fell. My knee hurts." （哎哟……是啊，我摔倒了，膝盖好疼。）
	A: "I noticed you were just falling. That was close!" （我刚才看你要摔倒了，真险啊！）
	B: "Yeah, I almost fell but managed to grab the rail." （是啊，差点就摔了，幸好我抓住了栏杆。）

on/of
	​on​ 表示带子附着于鞋面之上，强调动作发生的位置。
		Please ​fasten the strap on your shoes​ before running. 
	​of​ 表示带子是鞋子的一部分，强调所属关系，多用于描述而非指示动作。
		The strap of the shoe​ is made of leather. 

by/from
	​Raised by​	- Credits the agent (person/entity) initiating the issue	
		The issue raised by the auditor requires review.
​	 Raised from​ - Describes contextual origin (rarely used for agents)	
		The conflict raised from budget cuts." (Not agent-focused)

will/would
	​现实性未来动作​：表示即将发生的具体行动或当前做出的决定，具有较高确定性。
		I will call you tomorrow.
	表示当前或未来的习惯性倾向（客观规律）
		I will always remember this day.
	非现实或假设性动作​：需依赖特定条件（常隐含或明示），或描述过去习惯(：描述过去重复性动作（≈ used to），但强调动作细节而非状态变化)
		I would travel more if I had money.
		When I was young, I would play chess every Sunday.
	would 的核心场景​：在虚拟条件句（与事实相反）中表达结果
		If I were you, I would accept the offer.
		I would have called, but my phone died.
	will 在条件句中仅表示“意愿”（非未来时态）
		If you will wait, I will check the schedule.
	will 直接表达意愿，可能显得生硬 would通过假设降低直接性，更委婉礼貌：
		I would like a coffee, please.
		I would appreciate your feedback.

yet/already/
	否定句 未完成（中性）
	He hasn’t replied ​yet.
	在疑问句中，“yet” 表示“已经”，用于中性询问进展，不带有惊讶情绪，常置于句末。
	Have you finished your homework yet?
	Is the tea cold yet?
	肯定句的“yet”意为“仍然”“还需”，但语气较正式，或用于强调持续性/未来可能性，常与比较级、最高级或情态动词搭配。
	She is yet a child.
	I have yet much to do."​（我还有许多事要做。）→ 强调任务剩余量。
	You must work yet harder."​（你还需更努力。）
	This is his best performance yet.（这是他迄今最好的表现。）
	The truth is yet to be revealed.（真相仍待揭露。）→ 正式表达“尚未发生但将来会”
	“Has Eric already shared the solution?​”→ 隐含惊讶（“他居然这么快就搞定了？！”）

whereby
	主要译为“‌凭此‌”、“‌借以‌”、“‌由此‌”或“‌从而‌”，强调通过某种方式或手段实现后续动作

the more time you put in hardwork, the more skills you acquire

### 文化习惯 

#### I would appreciate it if you …
If you want to be fluent in your usage, and you are willing to come off as formal and a bit peremptory and demanding, you would say, “I would appreciate it if you …” But unless you want to convey impatient formality, you would probably want to say instead, “I would be grateful if you …”

You would probably never in any circumstance say "I will appreciate if you.." or "I would appreciate if you.."

And you would also probably never even say "I will appreciate it if you.." This is just not the way English speakers speak. One reason you wouldn’t say “I will appreciate it” (besides the fact that it would sound impatient) is that you need to use the subjunctive “would” when you are using “if,” instead of the predictive “will.” You are only predicting that if a hypothetical event occurs, appreciation will occur. For instance: You impatiently say, “I would appreciate it if you would pay your rent.” You are predicting (or sarcastically claiming to predict) that if the rent is paid, you will be appreciative.

#### what happens vs what happened vs what has happened

| 表达形式              | 时态与结构 | 时间指向    | 核心焦点 | 典型使用场景 |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| What happens      | 一般现在时             | 现在或未来   | 常态规律、常规结果        | 科学规律、操作流程、日常惯例   |
| What happened     | 一般过去时             | 具体过去时间点 | 已结束的孤立事件         | 突发事件回顾、事故调查      |
| What has happened | 现在完成时（has + PP）   | 过去→现在   | 过去事件对当下的持续影响     | 突发状况、近期变化追踪      |

What happens* when you mix oil and water?"*（油水混合会发生什么？）→ ‌物理常态
Press this button to see ‌what happens‌. （按下按钮看结果）→ ‌可预见的操作反馈

What happened* to your leg? It's bruised!"*（你腿怎么了？有淤青！）→ ‌已发生的意外

The road is blocked! ‌What has happened‌?（道路封锁了！发生什么事了？）→ ‌现状与事件直接关联
You look upset. ‌What has happened‌ since morning?（你看起来沮丧，上午到现在发生什么了？）→ ‌追溯未明影响源
#### No worries 
is an expression seen in Australian English, British English and New Zealand English meaning "do not worry about that", "that's all right", or "sure thing". It is similar to the English no problem.

#### How are you? Good or well
Bottom line: You are good (and sometimes well). But you do well. 
"We danced well," not "We danced good." Adjectives are only used to describe nouns, as in "We performed a good dance."
"I'm good," is a proper response.
"I'm well" is also allowed but not for the reasons many think. That response only works if "well" takes on its adjectival form, meaning "in good health" or "good or satisfactory."
Now, if someone asks "How are you doing?" "I'm doing well" is the correct response. "Doing" — a form of "to do" — becomes the main verb, and action verbs require adverbs. 

#### "it's not working" and "it doesn't work"

it's not working 现在进行时（强调进行中状态） 当前临时故障或突发异常 设备突然失灵、软件卡顿
  My phone was fine this morning, but now ‌it's not working‌.（手机早还好好的，现在突然失灵了）
it doesn't work 一般现在时（描述常态或属性）固有缺陷或长期失效 设计缺陷、永久性损坏
  This old TV ‌doesn't work‌ even after repairs.（旧电视修了也修不好）

#### Is saying "Noted" a rude answer? If so, what are the alternative answers to reply to a person besides “Noted”? 
Noted is incorrect regardless of context. By its very brevity, it IS rude. It is used by people who think they are being “hip” or sounding uber-professional, when in fact they are in effect dismissing the other person.

If someone has given you an instruction in a business or professional or superior to lower-ranked person context, the correct response is “Yes”; or “I’ll do it [when] and deliver the finished product/result by [when]” (e.g., “Yes, Dad, I’ll take the trash out now, then start my homework.”)

If someone has told you a useful fact or taught you a skill or procedure, the polite response is “Thank you,” plus more words to indicate you understood what was conveyed, plus more words yet to indicate you appreciate the other person sharing knowledge or skills with you (e.g., “Thanks for pointing that out; now I understand that “noted” is a rude response because it doesn’t promise compliance and only serves to dismiss the other party.”)

If someone is complaining about something you’re doing, the polite response is “I’m sorry” plus a description of what you’ll do to rectify (“I’ll stop picking my nose”, or “I’ll send you a replacement immediately”). If you can’t or won’t comply, you should still begin with “I’m sorry” and continue with a polite explanation of the situation and whether you can do anything (e.g., “I’m sorry, we made a mistake on your reservation for a seaview room, but I’ll give you a complimentary upgrade to a suite which overlooks our interior garden; will that be satisfactory?”)

Noted as a response to an instruction means (by the absence of affirmative statements promising compliance) “I have no intention of doing this anytime soon; I’ll get around to it when I get around to it.”

Noted as a response to fact-sharing or skill-sharing means “I didn’t understand you, or I don’t agree with you, but I’ll say “Noted” so you stop talking.”

Noted as a response to a complaint means “I don’t plan to do anything about your complaint, but this conversation is now over.”

### Anecdote
“Do not shop at Mustafa Shopping Centre”
Me and my husband visited Singapore in March 08. I had earlier visited Singapore some 4-5 years back and I knew that Singapore is a shopping heaven. So I had Mustafa on my list.
We decided to buy Mobiles for us and we zeroed in on Mustafa after reading soooo many good reviews about it.We decided on the models and headed to Mustafa. I was actually surprised on how bad the place has turned out to be..lots of people were in the shop..the salesperson was unaware about the mobile features.We asked whether they will give us International Guarantee of these mobiles for which they refused. The place looked shady..But with good reviews on various forums we shirked all our doubts and went ahead and shopped the mobiles. All good..we returned home and started using the mobiles. My mobile worked fine for few days after which it hangs while I am talking..sometimes it refuses to ring even when I get calls..sometimes it refuses to make me ring a missed call..sometimes it simply blanks out!! The memory chip place holder is loose and so is the SIM holder place...My husbands mobile has similar problems.
So I would suggest that if someone is planning to shop in Mustafa its better you have good know how of the thing you are buying so that you dont feel cheated and if you dont have the know how then the best thing you can do is not to buy at all from there!

### About Crypto
Bitcoin led to a huge number of look-alike cryptocurrencies, and most public discussion has centred around the potential for illegal or illicit uses (such as the purchase of drugs on the Silk Road website). In keeping with the ‘libertarian’ origins of Bitcoin, it has been remarked that one of the major events which propelled Bitcoin to widespread adoption was the blockade of WikiLeaks by Visa and MasterCard.

‌翻译‌:
比特币催生了大量仿效型加密货币，且公众讨论多聚焦于其潜在的非法用途（例如在“暗网丝绸之路”上购买毒品）。与比特币的“自由意志主义”起源相一致，有观点指出，推动比特币被广泛采用的关键事件之一是维基解密（WikiLeaks）遭维萨（Visa）和万事达（MasterCard）支付封锁。

The S-course (or S-curve) is a specific maneuver taught during driving training. It involves navigating through a series of curves shaped like the letter "S," often to simulate sharp or winding roads. This type of course is designed to help new drivers practice controlling the vehicle while steering through tight turns, maintaining proper speed, and ensuring smooth handling of the car.

"Main Menu" vs. "Main Course":
+ Main Menu: Refers to the list of available food options or, in digital terms, the primary screen where choices or functions are displayed.
  At the main menu, you can choose your meal.
+ Main Course: In a meal, "course" refers to a specific part of a multi-course meal, typically the most substantial or important dish (such as a main dish following appetizers).
  For the main course, we’re having steak.
  In this context, "course" refers to the sequence or stage in a meal (e.g., starter, main course, dessert). The word "course" is used here because a meal is divided into different parts, each one being a stage of the overall dining experience.
