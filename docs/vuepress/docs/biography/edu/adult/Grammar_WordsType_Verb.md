interest bore ing&ed format http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_6e87738d0100n1g4.html （注意和被动语态分别 比如 familiarize be familiarized with ）
have make let

gets you to a deeper level of understanding

make
	例：The manager asked us to make the report uniform.（经理要求我们统一报告格式）。
	‌设计或生产‌：
	例：The factory makes all products uniform in size.（工厂使所有产品尺寸一致）

In the sentences below, the pronoun 'it' functions as an object, not as a subject. Objects do not agree in number with (what appear to be) verbs:
	I will make it happen.  
	You should let it happen.  
Below, the word 'he' functions as a subject, and so the verb agrees in number with its subject:
	I wish (that) he succeeds.  <but the semantics seem awkward to me; shouldn't it be 'I hope'?>

### Transitive Verbs (VT)​​
​​Definition:​​ Require a ​​direct object​​ to complete their meaning.
​​Example:​​

"She ​​ate​​ an apple." (Direct object = apple)
"He ​​kicked​​ the ball."
​​Key Point:​​ Without an object, the sentence is incomplete.
❌ She ate. → ❓ (What did she eat?)

#### Transitive Verb+infinitive 及物动词加不定时

box in
	The traffic boxed us in.（车流把我们困住了。
	My car was boxed in by a truck.
freak out 是 ‌多功能口语短语‌，核心用法包括：
	及物动词（freak sb out）表“使某人失控”
	不及物动词（freak out）表“自行情绪爆发”
mean to
	means many things to many people, to some it's xxx to others xx
	mean 为 ‌及物动词‌，需接宾语（如 mean something 或 mean to do）
	to 为 ‌不定式标记‌（非介词），引导动作目标（mean to help = “打算帮助”）
	‌不可替换‌：mean to 中的 to 不能改为其他介词（如 mean for 含义不同）

walk you through
get through
lift it up  sum up  assemble up

### Intransitive Verbs (VI)​​
​​Definition:​​ Do ​​not require an object​​; the action stays with the subject.
Intransitive verbs can be followed by a **prepositional phrase** or an **adverb** to add to the thought being expressed

​​Example:​​

"The baby ​​slept​​."
"They ​​arrived​​."
​​Key Point:​​ Can stand alone as a complete sentence.


#### Intransitive Verbs with Prepositions​​
​​Definition:​​ Intransitive verbs followed by ​​optional prepositional phrases​​ (not objects).
​​Example:​​

"He ​​ran​​ to the store." (Prepositional phrase = to the store)
"They ​​laughed​​ at the joke."
​​Key Point:​​ The verb is still complete without the prepositional phrase.
✅ He ran.
