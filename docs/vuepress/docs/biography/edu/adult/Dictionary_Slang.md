Crap 
Native speakers' brains are already on the right path. We won't mess it up in a conversation between native English speakers. When a native speaker hears, "What's your name? Mine ..." we already have "is" in our heads queued up. If we hear anything else, we will be surprised. A non-native speaker may not have this anticipation, and may hear "Minus" instead of "Mine is". This exact problem happened this morning between my German roommate and me.
Native speakers would almost never hear "minus" where the speaker said "mine is", and likewise we will never confuse "crab" for "crap".

Of course, I make the assumption that the speaker is also a native speaker. Non-native English speakers also have subtle linguistic clumsiness that throws off this anticipation effect. So another time we could mess it up is if the speaker says something that we have to parse word-by-word to understand, throwing off the sense of rhythm and anticipation.
Which between “crap” and “shit” is more rude?

in the wild:
Part of the use of the slang term “in the wild,” which was popularized by the HBO TV series "Silicon Valley," relies upon an analogy to the natural world. In nature, people look for wildlife and plants in the wild, where they are beyond any human monitoring or supervision.
