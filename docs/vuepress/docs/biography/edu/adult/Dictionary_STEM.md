This is a pretty straightforward collapse operation where we make the elements arrange themselves in a vertical fashion as opposed to horizontally.
I’ll only depict the operative element. Any markup within it that is not immediately relevant will be truncated [it’s still there but I just won’t show it] and replaced with the HTML comment with caption ‘MARKUP TRUNCATED’ [I’ll also do the same for Javascript code with caption ‘CODE TRUNCATED’].
Now this task is a real doozy. We’re going to need to enable two different navigational systems, one for the original website, and the other for the mobile website. However, they have to consume the same markup space.

You must first of all obtain a list of all the sub-areas contained within specified area(including all their sub-areas, and so on for all levels of containment)
Although the links between objects may be duplicated, introducing some redundancy, it is useful if traversal of the hierarchy has to take place in both direction, i.e. if it necessary to be able to go from a child to its parents as well as from a parent to its children. Possible problem is loss of consistency(i.e. A links to B but not vice versa), due to programming/maintenance errors.

隔离 绝缘 insulate
Database interactions should be encapsulated within private methods, insulating the consumer from the details of the database and its associated tables.
A factory is the location of a concrete class in the code at which objects are constructed. The intent in employing the pattern is to insulate the creation of objects from their usage and to create families of related objects without having to depend on their concrete classes.
隔离 孤立isolate
The Repository pattern helps to isolate both the service and the list access code. Isolation makes it easier to treat them as independent services and to replace them with mock objects in unit tests.

b. To become smaller from exposure to heat, moisture, or cold: The sweater shrank in the wash.
2. To become reduced in amount or value; dwindle: His savings quickly shrank. The market for that product has been shrinking.
3. To move back or away, especially in fear: "She shrank back against the wall and flattened her palms against it" (Pearl S. Buck).
4. To show reluctance; hesitate: We should not shrink from making such a sacrifice.

Designing and developing an OO System involves Abstraction - the process of defining objects.
Real world objects are transformed into an automated world comprising the software equivalents of the real world objects.
Extracting relevant characteristics of real world objects into software objects.
OO Misconceptions
Many still think OO means programming in OO programming languages,but programming issues are only a part
in relation to larger issues of OO analysis,design and management.
Software engineering involves more things than programming languages,it involves planning, requirements
gathering, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance etc.

In MAXWARE, the design stage is very informal. More often design specifications are produced only for major and critical modules. Review of the design specifications are done by the senior development staff, who have more experience. The design specifications are then handed over to the programmers to start the coding. "We can do well even without design as long as we trust our engineers and programmers...", say the development managers, whenever there is an issue or comment about practicing more formal and disciplined design process. Some of the other reasons given are: short development time and attitude of some team members towards additional work and responsibility.

在 MAXWARE 公司，设计阶段非常非正式。通常只会针对主要或关键模块编写设计文档。设计文档的评审由经验更丰富的高级开发人员完成。评审后的文档将移交给程序员进行编码。每当有人提议采用更正式、规范化的设计流程时，开发经理总会表示：“只要信任工程师和程序员，即使不设计也能做好……” 此外，其他理由还包括：开发周期短，以及部分团队成员对额外工作和责任的抵触态度。

D3.js is a JavaScript library that is widely used in data visualisation and animation. The power of d3.js and its flexibility, comes at the expense of its steep learning curve. There are some libraries built on top of it that provide numerous off-the-shelf charts in order to make the users’ life easier, however, learning to work with d3.js is essential sometimes, especially when you need to create sophisticated and custom visualisations.
If you are not familiar with d3.js, you can read this introduction. In brief, just like jQuery and other DOM manipulation frameworks, it allows you to dynamically manipulate the properties and attributes of your HTML document elements. Nevertheless, it doesn’t stop here. Its power comes from two additional functionality. It can also create and manipulate SVG elements, and it can also bind the DOM or SVG elements to arrays of data, so that any changes in that data will be reflected on those elements they are binded to. There are numerous SVG shapes, such as circles, rectangles, paths and texts. Those shapes serve as the building blocks of your visualisations. For example, a bar chart is composed of multiple rectangles. while a scatter plot is made of circles scattered in different parts of you drawing area. You may also want to see this interactive tutorial about creating and manipulation SVG elements, as well as binding them to data arrays. - See more at: http://schoolofdata.org/2013/10/01/pie-and-donut-charts-in-d3-js


There are a few things that I find incredibly attractive when it comes to NativeScript.  These are benefits that have kept me attached to the framework for as long as I’ve been.
You could spend a week building the feature, and you might be reinventing the wheel. Sounds like it’s time to see what’s on the shelf!
Today’s business environment is constantly disrupted by new players leveraging innovative technology. 93% of technology and business leaders believe that their businesses will be deeply affected by digital. Only companies who adopt strong digital competencies can become the winners of tomorrow.
 
if you're a web developer, you can use React Native to write clean, fast mobile apps, from the comfort of a familiar framework and a single JavaScript codebase.
React has seen widespread adoption.
Developers have flocked to React for a number of reasons. It's lightweight, and offers impressive performance, especially for quickly-changing data. Because of its component structure, it also encourages you to naturally write more modular, reusable code.
Because your application is mostly just JavaScript, you get a lot of the perks of web development, like being able to instantly "refresh" your application to see your code changes.Compared to the long minutes spent waiting to rebuild a traditional mobile application, this feels like a godsend.
Being able to write truly native iOS and Android apps using a single JavaScript codebase seems like a no-brainer.
In lieu of tags such as <div>, <img>, and <p>, React Native provides you with basic components such as <Text> and <View>.
In practice, this means that you can write what looks like ordinary React code, and the React Native "bridge" will take care of the heavy lifting. But what happens when the bridge is incomplete?
Happily, React Native gives you the flexibility to write and use these so-called "native modules" when you need to, and the process is straightforward.
Deploying React Native applications is very similar to working with ordinary mobile applications. That doesn't mean it's easy, as the mobile release process is known for its headaches.
Angular's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write.


Survey of benefits perceived from systems architecture among 86 respoinding organizations.
Solution Architecture commonly describes the components required for and end-to-end solution, tying together patterns from more than one domain.
A Solution Architect may shield the Enterprise/Segment Architect from the unnecessary details of the systems, products, and/or technologies.
Detailed Design is representing sufficient details for implementing the system.
Good object oriented design practices also apply at architectural level.
The Architect defines solutions to client business problems through the reasoned application of information technology.These solutions are manifested as architectures and can include systems, applications and process components.
Architecture is the organization of components, its relationship to each other and to the environment, governed by the principles.
Modularity is the degree to which a system or computer program is composed of discrete components such that a change to one component has minimal impact on other components
Competitive pressure and short window of opportunity
Efficiency: resource expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness with which users achieve goals
Each tier acts as a server for its caller and client to the next tier in the architecture.
NoSQL can be strong or eventual consistency.
Records the significant decisions made in shaping the overall architecture, and describes the rationale used in making the decision, the options considered, and the implications of the decision. Focus on high impact, high priority areas that are in strong alignment with the business strategy.

The model reflects the underlying concept that each cycle involves a progression that addresses the same sequence of steps for each portion of the product and for each of its levels of elaboration.
WorkFlow: State Machine https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg983472(v=vs.110).aspx
Drag an Assign activity from the Primitives section of the Toolbox and drop onto the Exit section of the state.
Type Turns into the To box and Turns + 1 into the Enter a C# expression or Enter a VB expression box.
Return to the overall state machine view in the workflow designer by clicking StateMachine in the breadcrumb display at the top of the workflow designer.
Drag a FinalState activity from the State Machine section of the Toolbox, hover it over the Enter Guess state, and drop it onto the triangle that appears to the right of the Enter Guess state so that a transition is created between Enter Guess and FinalState.
The default name of the transition is T2. Click the transition in the workflow designer to select it, and set its DisplayName to Guess Correct. Then click and select the FinalState, and drag it to the right so that there is room for the full transition name to be displayed without overlaying either of the two states. This will make it easier to complete the remaining steps in the tutorial.
Double-click the newly renamed Guess Correct transition in the workflow designer to expand it.
Drag a ReadInt activity from the NumberGuessWorkflowActivities section of the Toolbox and drop it in the Trigger section of the transition.
In the Properties Window for the ReadInt activity, type "EnterGuess" including the quotes into the BookmarkName property value box, and type Guess into the Result property value box
Type the following expression into the Guess Correct transition’s Condition property value box.

data capture - the action or process of gathering data, especially from an automatic device, control system, or sensor.
data dump - a large amount of data transferred from one system or location to another.
data replication - is the frequent electronic copying data from a database in one computer or server to a database in another so that all users share the same level of information. The result is a distributed database in which users can access data relevant to their tasks without interfering with the work of others.
dummy data - In Informatics, dummy data is benign information that does not contain any useful data, but serves to reserve space where real data is nominally present. Dummy data can be used as a placeholder for both testing and operational purposes.

### project presentation
This prototype is for demonstrating our high level architecture which is designed by Mr.Jagdish,
and contributed by all of our team members.
The Use Case we pick up is 'Purchase Product', for this is one of the most complicated one.
For Presentation we chose to use MVC Framework,because by using MVC we can fast adopting multiple features
like URL routing/session management/authentication and authorization etc., for view engine we use razor,
which can set master layout/partial layout, make our live much easier.
OK, now I show you the demo, first as a guest or before you login to the website, it's allowed to add any items
into your shopping cart,(show the process,)
but you must login to proceed payment, now I login using an existing account,
let's continue to proceed payment, you are request to provide delivery address, next time this address will
be list down for you to choose, ok, submit, we are redirecting to pay-pal merchant payment page, as we are
using sandbox to test, let me key-in test account,
Now we are succeed, now we can go to member center to check our order
