### business dialogue

Hey xxx, free to sync on the haircut logic later? Want to ensure I'm on the right track.

so is the new product already returned from api?
Yes, but typically only after the product is officially launched. APIs usually connect to the production database, so only data from launched products is accessible through the API.

All APIs will return complete data when available. For testing, ensure the testing API environment is fully populated with the required data (there seems to be a gap in data handover from Luis to me). For production, data will only be accessible after the official launch.

Hi team, I've identified a gap in the data handover from peter to me. To resolve this, could you confirm whether Luis had set up the testing API for you yesterday? This will help me ensure data continuity and proper configuration.

Based on this, it appears testing APIs were never utilized from the outset. Let me also search through document backups to verify if any testing APIs existed previously.

I would like to schedule a brief meeting later today to provide an update on the CAMT053 test. Please let me know what time would be convenient for you.

This is to confirm that the settlement price displayed on a Monday (before 7:00 PM) should be the one from the previous Friday.

The 'Accounts' category in the Excel file appears to be empty. What is the best way to verify its accuracy, regardless of whether it contains data or is supposed to be blank?

touch base vs discuss
    Would it be possible to connect briefly today at your convenience to discuss the clearing repository permissions?
    do you have a few minutes today to touch base on the clearing repo permissions? Thanks!

Is UAT testing performed in a test environment? If yes, how is the test environment maintained and how does APEX make sure it represents the production environment at the time of testing?

"To my knowledge, there is no test environment. You should probably confirm with the Finance Department or the person who purchased this service. As far as I know, Yonyou provides their service by having users log into their system. All services are offered by Yonyou and are not hosted on our end."


Are there scheduled jobs / batch jobs set up within the Yonyou application?

If applicable, please provide details of the scheduled jobs in the system showing the job names and frequencies.

"To my knowledge, no scheduled or batch jobs are configured on our end. If you are referring to business-process-related jobs (e.g., financial closing, automated reports), I recommend confirming with the Finance Department, as the IT team only manages user access and does not handle business-domain configurations.

If your question pertains to scheduled jobs on Yonyou’s side (such as system backups or data synchronization), note that these are fully managed by Yonyou. Their internal processes are not visible to us, so we do not have details regarding job names or frequencies."

“has followed up” (现在完成时) 在商务沟通中通常比 “is following up” (现在进行时) 更专业、更常用

​视角​：强调 ​动作的完成及其对现在的影响。它表达的意思是“供应商已经跟进过了（这个动作完成了），而我们现在收到了这个信息，需要处理它”。

​隐含意义​：关注的是“跟进”这个事实本身，以及它给我们带来的结果（即我们需要行动）。它听起来像是一个客观的、已经发生的事件陈述，为我们的请求提供了一个中立的理由。

The vendor is following up. (现在进行时)​​

​视角​：描述 ​当前正在发生的动作。它表达的意思是“供应商此刻正在跟进”。

​隐含意义​：这会给人一种“供应商正在紧盯着我们”的紧迫感，甚至可能带有一丝被催促的压迫感。在某些情况下，可能会被解读为你在向经理传递压力。

speculate vs hedge vs invest vs infer
  The main purpose of speculation, on the other hand, is to profit from betting on the direction in which an asset will be moving. Hedgers reduce their risk by taking an opposite position in the market to what they are trying to hedge.
  The main difference between speculating and investing is the amount of of risk undertaken in the trade. Typically, high-risk trades that are almost akin to gambling fall under the umbrella of speculation, whereas lower-risk investments based on fundamentals and analysis fall into the category of investing.
  As verbs the difference between speculate and infer is that speculate is to think, meditate or reflect on a subject; to consider, to deliberate or cogitate while infer is to introduce (something) as a reasoned conclusion; to conclude by reasoning or deduction, as from premises or evidence.

retrenchment
He said such benefits should apply to all staff, including professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) and management. Currently, retrenchment benefits are determined by agreements between employers and employees.

North Korea (officially known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, or DPRK) has owned the title of “Most Worthless Government on Earth” for decades. It owes that title to many things; one of them is its monopoly on the information to which its citizens have access. (Others include things like imprisoning and executing dissidents.)
