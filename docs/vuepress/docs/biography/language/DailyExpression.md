Crap 
Native speakers' brains are already on the right path. We won't mess it up in a conversation between native English speakers. When a native speaker hears, "What's your name? Mine ..." we already have "is" in our heads queued up. If we hear anything else, we will be surprised. A non-native speaker may not have this anticipation, and may hear "Minus" instead of "Mine is". This exact problem happened this morning between my German roommate and me.
Native speakers would almost never hear "minus" where the speaker said "mine is", and likewise we will never confuse "crab" for "crap".
- http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/15045/is-it-common-for-english-people-to-say-crap-instead-of-crab
Of course, I make the assumption that the speaker is also a native speaker. Non-native English speakers also have subtle linguistic clumsiness that throws off this anticipation effect. So another time we could mess it up is if the speaker says something that we have to parse word-by-word to understand, throwing off the sense of rhythm and anticipation.
No worries 
is an expression seen in Australian English, British English and New Zealand English meaning "do not worry about that", "that's all right", or "sure thing". It is similar to the English no problem.
## Think in English

"I would do it" and "I would have done it"?
https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-I-would-do-it-and-I-would-have-done-it-Why

How are you? Good or well
https://www.businessinsider.com/how-are-you-im-good-is-acceptable-reply-2014-2/?IR=T

who'd have guessed? 谁能猜得到？
误：I think I can't.
正：I don't think I can.
提示：汉语里说“我想我不会”的时候，英语里面总是说“我不认为我会”。以后在说类似的英语句子的时候，只要留心，也会习惯英语的表达习惯的。
误：I don't dance well too.
正：I am not a very good dancer either.
提示：当我们说不擅长做什么事情的时候，英语里面通常用not good at something，英语的思维甚至直接跳跃到：我不是一个好的舞者。
误：I have something to do tomorrow.
正：I am tied up all day tomorrow.
提示：用I have something to do来表示很忙，这也完全是中国式的说法。因为每时每刻我们都有事情要做，躺在那里睡大觉也是事情。所以可以说我很忙，脱不开身：I'm tied up。还有其它的说法：I can't make it at that time. I'd love to, but I can't, I have to stay at home.
误：Would you like to join our party on Friday?
正：Would you like to come to our party on Friday night?
提示：join往往是指参加俱乐部或者协会，如：join a health club; join the Communist Party。事实上，常常与party搭配的动词是come 或者go。如go a wild party，或者come to a Christmas Party。
误：I have no experience.
正：I don't know much about that.
提示：I have no experience这句话听起来古里古怪，因为只需要说那方面我懂得不多，或者这方面我不在行，就行了。I am not really an expert in this area。
--Will you be going back home for the Spring Festival?
误：--Of course!
正：--Sure. / Certainly.
提示：以英语为母语的人使用of course的频率要比中国的学生低得多，只有在回答一些众所周知的问题时才说of course。因为of course后面隐含的一句话是“我当然知道啦！难道我是一个傻瓜吗？”因此，of course带有挑衅的意味。在交谈时，用sure或certainly效果会好得多。同时，of course not也具挑衅的意味。正常情况下语气温和的说法是certainly not。
误：The price is very suitable for me.
正：The price is right.
提示：suitable(合适的、相配的)最常见的用法是以否定的形式出现在告示或通知上，如：下列节目儿童不宜。The following programme is not suitable for children.
command respect 必然得到尊重
Support gives peace of mind (like insurance) and throat to choke (even if bug fix might not be immediate)
A throat to choke

There are a few things that I find incredibly attractive when it comes to NativeScript.  These are benefits that have kept me attached to the framework for as long as I’ve been.
You could spend a week building the feature, and you might be reinventing the wheel. Sounds like it’s time to see what’s on the shelf!
Today’s business environment is constantly disrupted by new players leveraging innovative technology. 93% of technology and business leaders believe that their businesses will be deeply affected by digital. Only companies who adopt strong digital competencies can become the winners of tomorrow.
 
if you're a web developer, you can use React Native to write clean, fast mobile apps, from the comfort of a familiar framework and a single JavaScript codebase.
React has seen widespread adoption.
Developers have flocked to React for a number of reasons. It's lightweight, and offers impressive performance, especially for quickly-changing data. Because of its component structure, it also encourages you to naturally write more modular, reusable code.
Because your application is mostly just JavaScript, you get a lot of the perks of web development, like being able to instantly "refresh" your application to see your code changes.Compared to the long minutes spent waiting to rebuild a traditional mobile application, this feels like a godsend.
Being able to write truly native iOS and Android apps using a single JavaScript codebase seems like a no-brainer.
In lieu of tags such as <div>, <img>, and <p>, React Native provides you with basic components such as <Text> and <View>.
In practice, this means that you can write what looks like ordinary React code, and the React Native "bridge" will take care of the heavy lifting. But what happens when the bridge is incomplete?
Happily, React Native gives you the flexibility to write and use these so-called "native modules" when you need to, and the process is straightforward.
Deploying React Native applications is very similar to working with ordinary mobile applications. That doesn't mean it's easy, as the mobile release process is known for its headaches.
Angular's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write.
