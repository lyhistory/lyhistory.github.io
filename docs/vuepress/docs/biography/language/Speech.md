Discrimination is the prejudicial treatment of individuals based on their membership,
or perceived membership, in a certain group, such as race, ethnicity, religion, skin color, etc.
It involves the group's initial reaction or interaction,influencing someone's behavior toward the group,
restricting members of one group from opportunities that are available to another group, leading to
the exclusion of the individual or group based on logical or irrational decision making.

North Korea (officially known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, or DPRK) has owned the title of “Most Worthless Government on Earth” for decades. It owes that title to many things; one of them is its monopoly on the information to which its citizens have access. (Others include things like imprisoning and executing dissidents.)

retrenchment
He said such benefits should apply to all staff, including professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) and management. Currently, retrenchment benefits are determined by agreements between employers and employees.
Mr Lim also suggested that the retrenchment benefit law should compel companies to pay a minimum sum of between three and six months of benefits, depending on the employee's length of service.

## Presentation
If following a specific methodology, be explicit about what it is and how it works to all involved
the likely implications of change
increase visibility into operational efficiencies and bottlenecks
improve customer service and retention
tread with caution
Friction is normal as is conflict, don't avoid it altogether
different flavors of
*** is potentially complimentary to ***
market fashions
gets you to a deeper level of understanding
The tools vary widely and have been designed to meet an array of situations.
Sell the vision of what you want to be able to do
Clearly articulate the problem and opportunities using business language
late arrival - belate
usability presents many challenges
The project may strive to make the enterprise more effective, but success hinges on end-user adoption
A consultant with specific credentials in implementing successful BPM systems can be an asset.
Consultants run the gamut from strategic advisors to nuts-and-bolts integrator.
A sudden spike in interest in 'Green' options has taken us by surprise, how to offer energy efficient models, and still manage our legacy inventory.
My sales process is more costly than my competitors - how to reduce yet stay competitive.
How can I provide some kind of local service, without blowing my budget.
Don't lose sight of the business plan you created, among the cross-currents of internal politics and group management.
'Successful' projects run in isolation may have a negative impact in unexpected places.
evaluate the situation from various angles and identify core issues.
Inadequate appreciation of the human dynamics can crush great projects.
85% of system defects originate in requirements
45% of project costs are attributable to rework.
Locating relevant docs can be time consuming; some documents may be redundant or outdated; reading and summarizing disparate documentation is difficult; there is a danger of getting sucked into detail and not seeing process-level information
Questionnaire may well be ignored by recipients, requires a concise and very well thought out explanation to each recipient, can be the cause of much speculation and disruption due to the blunt nature of a blank questionnaire.
meter your expectation accordingly
when the heat is intense
have I adequately catalogued exceptions?
Processes obey a standard set of rules and policies
Vary widely in capabilities
The reality is far more complex tools for moving from modeling to execution are evolving slowly.
Are hand-off smooth?
If inputs coming into the process naturally cluster, then you may need to consider separating out into multiple sub-processes
Flowcharts and models can help to iron out logical problems, but that's not always the complete picture.
Complex interactions are multidimensional
Be aware of complexity - but don't be overwhelmed by it - capture essentials
Both role and user routing fall foul if not kept current
Structures can be open to debate
you will encounter resistance regardless of which approach you take
Appropriate methodologies must be adapted to face hard realities
The process itself needs to be continuously improved by disciplined redefinition and refinement
Treat geographically dispersed resources as though they were centralized.
Put the decision point where the work is performed, and build control into the process.
The difference is in the amount of emphasis each one places on individual steps
Identify the steps required to ingest new technology -- if needed-- into the enterprise
Only when you are sure your existing toolset will not suffice should you go out into the marketplace
Documentation and training can be refined in light of experience
The driver is a stronger organization that can deliver ever increasing benefits.
Usually trust is not that high, therefore your goal is to pinpoint hotspots of distrust and manage accordingly
Plan for it and identify it early on -- and your chances of success will rise substantially
These methods share common themes.
boxed in
Time/Costs need to be accurately factored into the process model to have real value.
To be of value needs to be highly accurate and in near or real time.
How many jobs waiting to step through task/overdue
Thresholds exceeded -- escalation to supervisor.
Simulations allows you to undertake a dry run of processes, can show you bottlenecks, breaks, unresolved loops, etc.
Point out flaws or missing pieces in a strategic approach
Business value frequently stems from cross-silo process improvements
The loudest complaints emanated from it.
Tendency to see systems consolidation as an end in itself.
*** means many things to many people, to some it's ***, to others ***
*** is a bit of both
Workflow model is still in wide use today, however, it did not account fully for emerging complexity.
The process should be agnostic as to whether the process step is human to human or system to system.
service costs can skyrocket out of control.
self-synchronization
Only the right information is seen by the right people
That documents can be checked in and out to ensure continuity and an audit trail of changes
Measurement is a never-ending quest, but true analytics ( as opposed to simple metrics) requires more sophisticated tools
stable system means that the impact of changes are localized
Build a system that is elastic and changes according to the required traffic
Although sometimes you can hide behind technical jargons, having an understandable make it easier to change it in the future
when some of the underlying assumption changes
Based on the pattern of historical data, extrapolate the same pattern into the future
 
comparatively relatively
 
In view of the limited time for Day 2 lesson this week, please spend some time to read the following topics before the lesson. If you have any specific questions on these topics, feel free to let me know in advance.
I will still be going through important points on these topics, the rest of the Day 2 lesson time will be used for in-class discussions.
I will also be spending some time to discuss the scenario for the first individual assignment and specific areas which are out of scope for the examination during Day 2 lesson.
 
Survey of benefits perceived from systems architecture among 86 respoinding organizations.
Solution Architecture commonly describes the components required for and end-to-end solution, tying together patterns from more than one domain.
A Solution Architect may shield the Enterprise/Segment Architect from the unnecessary details of the systems, products, and/or technologies.
Detailed Design is representing sufficient details for implementing the system.
Good object oriented design practices also apply at architectural level.
The Architect defines solutions to client business problems through the reasoned application of information technology.These solutions are manifested as architectures and can include systems, applications and process components.
Architecture is the organization of components, its relationship to each other and to the environment, governed by the principles.
Modularity is the degree to which a system or computer program is composed of discrete components such that a change to one component has minimal impact on other components
Competitive pressure and short window of opportunity
Efficiency: resource expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness with which users achieve goals
Each tier acts as a server for its caller and client to the next tier in the architecture.
NoSQL can be strong or eventual consistency.
Records the significant decisions made in shaping the overall architecture, and describes the rationale used in making the decision, the options considered, and the implications of the decision. Focus on high impact, high priority areas that are in strong alignment with the business strategy.
tailored to the needs
The user opts to reserve the slot by clicking on the reserve button
Integrity: protecting the 'accuracy' of information processing and data from improper modification
Confidentiality: Protecting the secrecy and privacy of information
Availability: Ensuring that the systems and data can be accessed when required
Structure a system so that all access by clients to resources is mediated by a guard which enforces a security policy.

It was not immediately clear if she had been left there by a parent or guardian, and for how long.
Netizens were quick to condemn the act, with many of them blaming the girl’s parents for resorting to such measures to punish their child.

It is later established that ....
The customer had signed the proposal to indicate acceptance.
start off
In MAXWARE, the design stage is very informal. More often design specifications are produced only for major and critical modules. Review of the design specifications are done by the senior development staff, who have more experience. The design specifications are then handed over to the programmers to start the coding. "We can do well even without design as long as we trust our engineers and programmers...", say the development managers, whenever there is an issue or comment about practicing more formal and disciplined design process. Some of the other reasons given are: short development time and attitude of some team members towards additional work and responsibility.
There are no software testing tools employed other than some test programs written and/or modified by the programmers themselves.
In an incident, the software system crashed and was disrupted necessitating a re-build of the system. When the build was completed and released to the customer, he reported some more bugs. It was realized that these bugs had previously been rectified.
In that short time, she managed to tighten up the process for handling field reported incidents and the consequential resolution of defects.
The users could not articulate their needs and the analysts had to evolve them through working models created with the developers to help the users visualize the use of the system.
Unconventionally, the Requirements, Architecture and Design phases were by-passed. The scope of the project was based solely on the working model to represent the user's needs. The PM told the Systems Testing group to derive their test plans and test cases using the working model in lieu of the requirements and design documents.
The situation was exacerbated by the continuous stream of changes to the requirements. Unknown to the analysts and developers, the users held several sessions amongst themselves to further orientate themselves to the working model.
Fortunately, the QM maintained rigorously tracking of all defects, including the classification and characterization of each.
Testing the first iteration had been a significant struggle for the System Testers. Most defects were due to ambiguous requirements or undocumented requirements that crept in through the emails
On average, for the same class severity defects, the rework effort and defect turnaround speed for the second iteration was almost triple that of what was registered in the first iteration. In essence, the actual application developed up to that point was far from what had been written in the test plan and test cases for the project.
Everything turned out well in the end.
There are still occasional high severity defects, but many more are minor ones now.

## Anecdote
“Do not shop at Mustafa Shopping Centre”
Me and my husband visited Singapore in March 08. I had earlier visited Singapore some 4-5 years back and I knew that Singapore is a shopping heaven. So I had Mustafa on my list.
We decided to buy Mobiles for us and we zeroed in on Mustafa after reading soooo many good reviews about it.We decided on the models and headed to Mustafa. I was actually surprised on how bad the place has turned out to be..lots of people were in the shop..the salesperson was unaware about the mobile features.We asked whether they will give us International Guarantee of these mobiles for which they refused. The place looked shady..But with good reviews on various forums we shirked all our doubts and went ahead and shopped the mobiles. All good..we returned home and started using the mobiles. My mobile worked fine for few days after which it hangs while I am talking..sometimes it refuses to ring even when I get calls..sometimes it refuses to make me ring a missed call..sometimes it simply blanks out!! The memory chip place holder is loose and so is the SIM holder place...My husbands mobile has similar problems.
So I would suggest that if someone is planning to shop in Mustafa its better you have good know how of the thing you are buying so that you dont feel cheated and if you dont have the know how then the best thing you can do is not to buy at all from there!
