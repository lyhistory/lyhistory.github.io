修辞手法
metaphor,analogy,allusion
Maybe a good analogy here is bar codes and serial numbers. Take an iPod in a store. On the packaging will be a bar code. This tells the store what the product is, so when it is scanned, the system knows exactly what the product is and what it costs. It might even be able to know what color it is or where it was kept in the store. All iPod of this same type has the exact same barcode on them.
The iPod will also have a serial number on it which is absolutely unique to any other iPod (or any other device) in the world. The serial number doesn't know the price. It could, but for the store, this wouldn't be a very efficient way to store and use that data. Much easier to use the barcode, so that for example, if the price changed, you could just change the price for that bar code and not every individual serial number in your system.
This is much like ID's and Classes. Information that is reusable should be kept in a class and information that is totally unique should be kept in an ID.

Some stative verbs can sometimes be used in the continuous form, but with a change in meaning: I'm seeing Bob on Monday=I am meeting Bob)

## Phrase
A phrase is two or more words that do not contain the subject-verb pair necessary to form a clause. Phrases can be very short or quite long.
Certain phrases have specific names based on the type of word that begins or governs the word group: noun phrase, verb phrase, prepositional phrase, infinitive phrase, participle phrase(present participle and past participle), gerund phrase, and absolute phrase.

to-infinitive preposition phrase
 
what happens what happened what has happened
In the sentences below, the pronoun 'it' functions as an object, not as a subject. Objects do not agree in number with (what appear to be) verbs:
1.	I will make it happens. 
2.	You should let it happens.  
3.	I will make it happen.  
4.	You should let it happen.  
Below, the word 'he' functions as a subject, and so the verb agrees in number with its subject:
1.	I wish (that) he succeeds.  <but the semantics seem awkward to me; shouldn't it be 'I hope'?>
2.	I wish (that) he succeed.

will do 简单陈述将来要发生的动作; 而will be doing则强调将来发生这种动作的状态，及在此状态或背景下可能发生的其它动作。
The train will arrive in a few minutes. 一般将来时，仅指火车几分钟就要到达的客观事实
The train will be arriving in a few minutes. 将来进行时，指火车几分钟后到站的那种状态，可暗含做好准备上车，接人什么的意味。 如： The train will be arriving in a few minutes, let's be ready to get on board.
对比：
I will study English = 陈述将来的一个事实，将来的某个时间我会学英语。
I will be studying English =我在学习英语的时候，可能有其它事情发生。如: I will be studying English when you come to pick me up.
