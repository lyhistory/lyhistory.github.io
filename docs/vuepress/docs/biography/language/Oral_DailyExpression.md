努力保持清醒

### Analysis 
误：I think I can't.
正：I don't think I can.
提示：汉语里说“我想我不会”的时候，英语里面总是说“我不认为我会”。以后在说类似的英语句子的时候，只要留心，也会习惯英语的表达习惯的。
误：I don't dance well too.
正：I am not a very good dancer either.
提示：当我们说不擅长做什么事情的时候，英语里面通常用not good at something，英语的思维甚至直接跳跃到：我不是一个好的舞者。
误：I have something to do tomorrow.
正：I am tied up all day tomorrow.
提示：用I have something to do来表示很忙，这也完全是中国式的说法。因为每时每刻我们都有事情要做，躺在那里睡大觉也是事情。所以可以说我很忙，脱不开身：I'm tied up。还有其它的说法：I can't make it at that time. I'd love to, but I can't, I have to stay at home.
误：Would you like to join our party on Friday?
正：Would you like to come to our party on Friday night?
提示：join往往是指参加俱乐部或者协会，如：join a health club; join the Communist Party。事实上，常常与party搭配的动词是come 或者go。如go a wild party，或者come to a Christmas Party。
误：I have no experience.
正：I don't know much about that.
提示：I have no experience这句话听起来古里古怪，因为只需要说那方面我懂得不多，或者这方面我不在行，就行了。I am not really an expert in this area。
--Will you be going back home for the Spring Festival?
误：--Of course!
正：--Sure. / Certainly.
提示：以英语为母语的人使用of course的频率要比中国的学生低得多，只有在回答一些众所周知的问题时才说of course。因为of course后面隐含的一句话是“我当然知道啦！难道我是一个傻瓜吗？”因此，of course带有挑衅的意味。在交谈时，用sure或certainly效果会好得多。同时，of course not也具挑衅的意味。正常情况下语气温和的说法是certainly not。
误：The price is very suitable for me.
正：The price is right.
提示：suitable(合适的、相配的)最常见的用法是以否定的形式出现在告示或通知上，如：下列节目儿童不宜。The following programme is not suitable for children.

No worries 
is an expression seen in Australian English, British English and New Zealand English meaning "do not worry about that", "that's all right", or "sure thing". It is similar to the English no problem.



what happens what happened what has happened
In the sentences below, the pronoun 'it' functions as an object, not as a subject. Objects do not agree in number with (what appear to be) verbs:
1.	I will make it happens. 
2.	You should let it happens.  
3.	I will make it happen.  
4.	You should let it happen.  
Below, the word 'he' functions as a subject, and so the verb agrees in number with its subject:
1.	I wish (that) he succeeds.  <but the semantics seem awkward to me; shouldn't it be 'I hope'?>
2.	I wish (that) he succeed.  
what happened vs what has happened

2.will do VS will be doing
SLA said it will not be giving the club an alternative site for another golf course, but may offer it another area for social uses.
[box title="http://bulo.hujiang.com/question/293589/"]
will do 简单陈述将来要发生的动作; 而will be doing则强调将来发生这种动作的状态，及在此状态或背景下可能发生的其它动作。
The train will arrive in a few minutes. 一般将来时，仅指火车几分钟就要到达的客观事实
The train will be arriving in a few minutes. 将来进行时，指火车几分钟后到站的那种状态，可暗含做好准备上车，接人什么的意味。 如： The train will be arriving in a few minutes, let's be ready to get on board.
对比：
I will study English = 陈述将来的一个事实，将来的某个时间我会学英语。
I will be studying English =我在学习英语的时候，可能有其它事情发生。如: I will be studying English when you come to pick me up.

## Topic 
### Anecdote
“Do not shop at Mustafa Shopping Centre”
Me and my husband visited Singapore in March 08. I had earlier visited Singapore some 4-5 years back and I knew that Singapore is a shopping heaven. So I had Mustafa on my list.
We decided to buy Mobiles for us and we zeroed in on Mustafa after reading soooo many good reviews about it.We decided on the models and headed to Mustafa. I was actually surprised on how bad the place has turned out to be..lots of people were in the shop..the salesperson was unaware about the mobile features.We asked whether they will give us International Guarantee of these mobiles for which they refused. The place looked shady..But with good reviews on various forums we shirked all our doubts and went ahead and shopped the mobiles. All good..we returned home and started using the mobiles. My mobile worked fine for few days after which it hangs while I am talking..sometimes it refuses to ring even when I get calls..sometimes it refuses to make me ring a missed call..sometimes it simply blanks out!! The memory chip place holder is loose and so is the SIM holder place...My husbands mobile has similar problems.
So I would suggest that if someone is planning to shop in Mustafa its better you have good know how of the thing you are buying so that you dont feel cheated and if you dont have the know how then the best thing you can do is not to buy at all from there!

### About Crypto
Bitcoin led to a huge number of look-alike cryptocurrencies, and most public discussion has centred around the potential for illegal or illicit uses (such as the purchase of drugs on the Silk Road website). In keeping with the ‘libertarian’ origins of Bitcoin, it has been remarked that one of the major events which propelled Bitcoin to widespread adoption was the blockade of WikiLeaks by Visa and MasterCard.

‌翻译‌:
比特币催生了大量仿效型加密货币，且公众讨论多聚焦于其潜在的非法用途（例如在“暗网丝绸之路”上购买毒品）。与比特币的“自由意志主义”起源相一致，有观点指出，推动比特币被广泛采用的关键事件之一是维基解密（WikiLeaks）遭维萨（Visa）和万事达（MasterCard）支付封锁。

retrenchment
He said such benefits should apply to all staff, including professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) and management. Currently, retrenchment benefits are determined by agreements between employers and employees.
Mr Lim also suggested that the retrenchment benefit law should compel companies to pay a minimum sum of between three and six months of benefits, depending on the employee's length of service.

### About food

"Main Menu" vs. "Main Course":
+ Main Menu: Refers to the list of available food options or, in digital terms, the primary screen where choices or functions are displayed.
  At the main menu, you can choose your meal.
+ Main Course: In a meal, "course" refers to a specific part of a multi-course meal, typically the most substantial or important dish (such as a main dish following appetizers).
  For the main course, we’re having steak.
  In this context, "course" refers to the sequence or stage in a meal (e.g., starter, main course, dessert). The word "course" is used here because a meal is divided into different parts, each one being a stage of the overall dining experience.

speculate vs hedge vs invest vs infer
  The main purpose of speculation, on the other hand, is to profit from betting on the direction in which an asset will be moving. Hedgers reduce their risk by taking an opposite position in the market to what they are trying to hedge.
  The main difference between speculating and investing is the amount of of risk undertaken in the trade. Typically, high-risk trades that are almost akin to gambling fall under the umbrella of speculation, whereas lower-risk investments based on fundamentals and analysis fall into the category of investing.
  As verbs the difference between speculate and infer is that speculate is to think, meditate or reflect on a subject; to consider, to deliberate or cogitate while infer is to introduce (something) as a reasoned conclusion; to conclude by reasoning or deduction, as from premises or evidence.
