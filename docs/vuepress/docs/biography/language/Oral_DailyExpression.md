误：I think I can't.
正：I don't think I can.
提示：汉语里说“我想我不会”的时候，英语里面总是说“我不认为我会”。以后在说类似的英语句子的时候，只要留心，也会习惯英语的表达习惯的。

误：I don't dance well too.
正：I am not a very good dancer either.
提示：当我们说不擅长做什么事情的时候，英语里面通常用not good at something，英语的思维甚至直接跳跃到：我不是一个好的舞者。

误：I have something to do tomorrow.
正：I am tied up all day tomorrow.
提示：用I have something to do来表示很忙，这也完全是中国式的说法。因为每时每刻我们都有事情要做，躺在那里睡大觉也是事情。所以可以说我很忙，脱不开身：I'm tied up。还有其它的说法：I can't make it at that time. I'd love to, but I can't, I have to stay at home.

误：Would you like to join our party on Friday?
正：Would you like to come to our party on Friday night?
提示：join往往是指参加俱乐部或者协会，如：join a health club; join the Communist Party。事实上，常常与party搭配的动词是come 或者go。如go a wild party，或者come to a Christmas Party。

误：I have no experience.
正：I don't know much about that.
提示：I have no experience这句话听起来古里古怪，因为只需要说那方面我懂得不多，或者这方面我不在行，就行了。I am not really an expert in this area。

误：Will you be going back home for the Spring Festival? --Of course!
正：--Sure. / Certainly.
提示：以英语为母语的人使用of course的频率要比中国的学生低得多，只有在回答一些众所周知的问题时才说of course。因为of course后面隐含的一句话是“我当然知道啦！难道我是一个傻瓜吗？”因此，of course带有挑衅的意味。在交谈时，用sure或certainly效果会好得多。同时，of course not也具挑衅的意味。正常情况下语气温和的说法是certainly not。

误：The price is very suitable for me.
正：The price is right.
提示：suitable(合适的、相配的)最常见的用法是以否定的形式出现在告示或通知上，如：下列节目儿童不宜。The following programme is not suitable for children.

### 文化习惯 

#### I would appreciate it if you …
If you want to be fluent in your usage, and you are willing to come off as formal and a bit peremptory and demanding, you would say, “I would appreciate it if you …” But unless you want to convey impatient formality, you would probably want to say instead, “I would be grateful if you …”

You would probably never in any circumstance say "I will appreciate if you.." or "I would appreciate if you.."

And you would also probably never even say "I will appreciate it if you.." This is just not the way English speakers speak. One reason you wouldn’t say “I will appreciate it” (besides the fact that it would sound impatient) is that you need to use the subjunctive “would” when you are using “if,” instead of the predictive “will.” You are only predicting that if a hypothetical event occurs, appreciation will occur. For instance: You impatiently say, “I would appreciate it if you would pay your rent.” You are predicting (or sarcastically claiming to predict) that if the rent is paid, you will be appreciative.

#### what happens vs what happened vs what has happened

| 表达形式              | 时态与结构 | 时间指向    | 核心焦点 | 典型使用场景 |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| What happens      | 一般现在时             | 现在或未来   | 常态规律、常规结果        | 科学规律、操作流程、日常惯例   |
| What happened     | 一般过去时             | 具体过去时间点 | 已结束的孤立事件         | 突发事件回顾、事故调查      |
| What has happened | 现在完成时（has + PP）   | 过去→现在   | 过去事件对当下的持续影响     | 突发状况、近期变化追踪      |

What happens* when you mix oil and water?"*（油水混合会发生什么？）→ ‌物理常态
Press this button to see ‌what happens‌. （按下按钮看结果）→ ‌可预见的操作反馈

What happened* to your leg? It's bruised!"*（你腿怎么了？有淤青！）→ ‌已发生的意外

The road is blocked! ‌What has happened‌?（道路封锁了！发生什么事了？）→ ‌现状与事件直接关联
You look upset. ‌What has happened‌ since morning?（你看起来沮丧，上午到现在发生什么了？）→ ‌追溯未明影响源
#### No worries 
is an expression seen in Australian English, British English and New Zealand English meaning "do not worry about that", "that's all right", or "sure thing". It is similar to the English no problem.

#### How are you? Good or well
Bottom line: You are good (and sometimes well). But you do well. 
"We danced well," not "We danced good." Adjectives are only used to describe nouns, as in "We performed a good dance."
"I'm good," is a proper response.
"I'm well" is also allowed but not for the reasons many think. That response only works if "well" takes on its adjectival form, meaning "in good health" or "good or satisfactory."
Now, if someone asks "How are you doing?" "I'm doing well" is the correct response. "Doing" — a form of "to do" — becomes the main verb, and action verbs require adverbs. 

#### "it's not working" and "it doesn't work"

it's not working 现在进行时（强调进行中状态） 当前临时故障或突发异常 设备突然失灵、软件卡顿
  My phone was fine this morning, but now ‌it's not working‌.（手机早还好好的，现在突然失灵了）
it doesn't work 一般现在时（描述常态或属性）固有缺陷或长期失效 设计缺陷、永久性损坏
  This old TV ‌doesn't work‌ even after repairs.（旧电视修了也修不好）
  Your excuse ‌doesn't work‌ on the teacher.（你的借口对老师无效）
#### Is saying "Noted" a rude answer? If so, what are the alternative answers to reply to a person besides “Noted”? 
Noted is incorrect regardless of context. By its very brevity, it IS rude. It is used by people who think they are being “hip” or sounding uber-professional, when in fact they are in effect dismissing the other person.

If someone has given you an instruction in a business or professional or superior to lower-ranked person context, the correct response is “Yes”; or “I’ll do it [when] and deliver the finished product/result by [when]” (e.g., “Yes, Dad, I’ll take the trash out now, then start my homework.”)

If someone has told you a useful fact or taught you a skill or procedure, the polite response is “Thank you,” plus more words to indicate you understood what was conveyed, plus more words yet to indicate you appreciate the other person sharing knowledge or skills with you (e.g., “Thanks for pointing that out; now I understand that “noted” is a rude response because it doesn’t promise compliance and only serves to dismiss the other party.”)

If someone is complaining about something you’re doing, the polite response is “I’m sorry” plus a description of what you’ll do to rectify (“I’ll stop picking my nose”, or “I’ll send you a replacement immediately”). If you can’t or won’t comply, you should still begin with “I’m sorry” and continue with a polite explanation of the situation and whether you can do anything (e.g., “I’m sorry, we made a mistake on your reservation for a seaview room, but I’ll give you a complimentary upgrade to a suite which overlooks our interior garden; will that be satisfactory?”)

Noted as a response to an instruction means (by the absence of affirmative statements promising compliance) “I have no intention of doing this anytime soon; I’ll get around to it when I get around to it.”

Noted as a response to fact-sharing or skill-sharing means “I didn’t understand you, or I don’t agree with you, but I’ll say “Noted” so you stop talking.”

Noted as a response to a complaint means “I don’t plan to do anything about your complaint, but this conversation is now over.”

### Anecdote
“Do not shop at Mustafa Shopping Centre”
Me and my husband visited Singapore in March 08. I had earlier visited Singapore some 4-5 years back and I knew that Singapore is a shopping heaven. So I had Mustafa on my list.
We decided to buy Mobiles for us and we zeroed in on Mustafa after reading soooo many good reviews about it.We decided on the models and headed to Mustafa. I was actually surprised on how bad the place has turned out to be..lots of people were in the shop..the salesperson was unaware about the mobile features.We asked whether they will give us International Guarantee of these mobiles for which they refused. The place looked shady..But with good reviews on various forums we shirked all our doubts and went ahead and shopped the mobiles. All good..we returned home and started using the mobiles. My mobile worked fine for few days after which it hangs while I am talking..sometimes it refuses to ring even when I get calls..sometimes it refuses to make me ring a missed call..sometimes it simply blanks out!! The memory chip place holder is loose and so is the SIM holder place...My husbands mobile has similar problems.
So I would suggest that if someone is planning to shop in Mustafa its better you have good know how of the thing you are buying so that you dont feel cheated and if you dont have the know how then the best thing you can do is not to buy at all from there!

### About Crypto
Bitcoin led to a huge number of look-alike cryptocurrencies, and most public discussion has centred around the potential for illegal or illicit uses (such as the purchase of drugs on the Silk Road website). In keeping with the ‘libertarian’ origins of Bitcoin, it has been remarked that one of the major events which propelled Bitcoin to widespread adoption was the blockade of WikiLeaks by Visa and MasterCard.

‌翻译‌:
比特币催生了大量仿效型加密货币，且公众讨论多聚焦于其潜在的非法用途（例如在“暗网丝绸之路”上购买毒品）。与比特币的“自由意志主义”起源相一致，有观点指出，推动比特币被广泛采用的关键事件之一是维基解密（WikiLeaks）遭维萨（Visa）和万事达（MasterCard）支付封锁。

"Main Menu" vs. "Main Course":
+ Main Menu: Refers to the list of available food options or, in digital terms, the primary screen where choices or functions are displayed.
  At the main menu, you can choose your meal.
+ Main Course: In a meal, "course" refers to a specific part of a multi-course meal, typically the most substantial or important dish (such as a main dish following appetizers).
  For the main course, we’re having steak.
  In this context, "course" refers to the sequence or stage in a meal (e.g., starter, main course, dessert). The word "course" is used here because a meal is divided into different parts, each one being a stage of the overall dining experience.

speculate vs hedge vs invest vs infer
  The main purpose of speculation, on the other hand, is to profit from betting on the direction in which an asset will be moving. Hedgers reduce their risk by taking an opposite position in the market to what they are trying to hedge.
  The main difference between speculating and investing is the amount of of risk undertaken in the trade. Typically, high-risk trades that are almost akin to gambling fall under the umbrella of speculation, whereas lower-risk investments based on fundamentals and analysis fall into the category of investing.
  As verbs the difference between speculate and infer is that speculate is to think, meditate or reflect on a subject; to consider, to deliberate or cogitate while infer is to introduce (something) as a reasoned conclusion; to conclude by reasoning or deduction, as from premises or evidence.

It owes that title to many things; one of them is its monopoly on the information to which its citizens have access. (Others include things like imprisoning and executing dissidents.)
