The EYFS, or Early Years Foundation Stage, is a framework that sets the standards for the learning, development, and care of children from birth to five years old in England. 

## Core Vocabulary Scenes for Preschoolers​

Scene-based contextual learning (Typical daily routines & social interactions) 

先列场景再分解词汇，毕竟脱离场景的单词表对幼儿无效。我回忆英美EYFS（早期基础阶段）的框架，决定从最贴近3-5岁孩子生活的12个场景切入，比如晨间流程、情绪表达这类高频场景，而非按字母表教单词。

特别注意标注文化差异点：比如英国幼儿园用"mud kitchen"（泥巴厨房），美国则偏向"sand table"（沙盘），这些细节会影响教学材料的真实性。每个场景选10个左右基础词汇，刻意加入具象动词（wriggle跳、twirl转）和感叹词（whoops），因为幼儿对拟声词敏感。

后续例句设计要突出"幼儿能参与的实际语言互动"：晨间场景重点给简单祈使句（"Squeeze the toothpaste"），社交场景则多用选择疑问句（"Play blocks or dinosaurs?"）。用户之前喜欢拟声词教学，所以在交通场景保留"vroom vroom"这类表达，但新增童谣歌词强化记忆。

最后保留延展性提示：标注开放性问题（PHONICS启蒙）是为有进阶需求的家庭准备，避免信息过载但提供专业支持入口。用户连续两次要求教学方案，可能在准备早教素材库，后续可补充打印资源网站或TPR（全身反应）教学法。
