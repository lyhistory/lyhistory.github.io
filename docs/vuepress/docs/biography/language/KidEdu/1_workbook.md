[Oxford basics Classroom English Bryan GardnerFelicity Gardner](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUxMjU5MjQzNw==&mid=2247484973&idx=1&sn=301c3c84f73cfeeff713884f0af63a7d&chksm=f8a08f3400ea45f9e465c7ef1b25261e2e0a8b74152586223edb58bc41a225de01571d32042d#rd)

## Core Vocabulary Scenes for Preschoolers​

Scene-based contextual learning (Typical daily routines & social interactions) 

先列场景再分解词汇，毕竟脱离场景的单词表对幼儿无效。我回忆英美EYFS（早期基础阶段）的框架，决定从最贴近3-5岁孩子生活的12个场景切入，比如晨间流程、情绪表达这类高频场景，而非按字母表教单词。

特别注意标注文化差异点：比如英国幼儿园用"mud kitchen"（泥巴厨房），美国则偏向"sand table"（沙盘），这些细节会影响教学材料的真实性。每个场景选10个左右基础词汇，刻意加入具象动词（wriggle跳、twirl转）和感叹词（whoops），因为幼儿对拟声词敏感。

后续例句设计要突出"幼儿能参与的实际语言互动"：晨间场景重点给简单祈使句（"Squeeze the toothpaste"），社交场景则多用选择疑问句（"Play blocks or dinosaurs?"）。用户之前喜欢拟声词教学，所以在交通场景保留"vroom vroom"这类表达，但新增童谣歌词强化记忆。

最后保留延展性提示：标注开放性问题（PHONICS启蒙）是为有进阶需求的家庭准备，避免信息过载但提供专业支持入口。用户连续两次要求教学方案，可能在准备早教素材库，后续可补充打印资源网站或TPR（全身反应）教学法。

​​Physical Development​​: Build gross/fine motor skills through structured play.
​​Language Acquisition​​: Use functional English phrases during play.

### ​​Bathroom/Hygiene Routines​​
Key: Independence language

Why taught? Reduces accidents; promotes self-care. Critical for full-day US programs.
Key Phrase: "I need to potty!"

​​
#### 如厕训练​​ (Potty Time)

Key Readiness Signs​​:

🟢 ​​Physical​​: Bladder control (dry diapers ≥2 hours), ability to pull pants up/down.
🟢 ​​Cognitive​​: Understands simple commands ("Sit on the potty!"), expresses needs with words ("I need to go!")/gestures.
🟢 ​​Emotional​​: Shows discomfort with wet diapers, curiosity about adult toilet habits.

​**Step-by-Step Training Protocol​​**
​
1. ​Potty Introduction​​: Decorate child-sized potties while modeling phrases:
"Potty time! Sit down, please!" 

​2. ​Routine Practice​​: Have fully clothed children sit on the potty for 5 minutes daily to build familiarity.
Clothed sits for 3-5 minutes post-meals, chanting:
"Pants down, sit tight, wait for the tinkle!" 

3. ​​Accident Response​​: Calmly say:
"Oops! Pee goes in the potty. Let’s clean up!" 

​4. ​Reward System​​: Sticker charts for successful attempts; praise phrases:
"Hooray! You used the potty!"

**Core Skills & Language​​**

1. ​​Toilet Paper Use​​:
"Fold, wipe front to back—1, 2, 3! FLUSH!" 

​2. ​Privacy & Safety​​:
"Close the door. Knock first—wait for ‘OK!’" 

​​3. Cough/Sneeze Etiquette​​:
"Cough in your elbow, germs stay IN!" 咳嗽肘部挡口，病菌无处可走！
Cover mouth and nose, block droplets ‌“遮掩口鼻，阻截飞沫”‌

​**​Role-Play Scenarios​​**
​
1. ​Potty Puppet Show​​:
Teachers use puppets to model:
"Uh-oh! I feel wiggly! Time to RUN to the potty!" 
“wiggly”源自单词“wiggle”（扭动、蠕动），在口语中常以“feel wiggly”形式出现，描述一种身体内部 ‌不适或紧迫感‌，尤指肠胃蠕动带来的坐立不安感，常见于以下情境：

指儿童或成人 ‌肠胃不适、有便意或急需上厕所‌ 的感觉，类似“肚子咕噜叫”或“扭动感”。
在儿童语言中更常用，是一种可爱或委婉的表达，避免直接说“拉肚子”或“肚子痛”

家长教育儿童识别身体信号（如：“If you feel wiggly, go to the bathroom right away!”）。
日常幽默表达（如朋友间开玩笑说“I feel wiggly—be back in a minute!”）

(勿混淆为“feel jiggly”（指身体脂肪晃动）或“feel wobbly”（指头晕或腿软），后者更接近身体失衡。)

​​2. Privacy Practice​​:
Use "Do Not Disturb" signs on stalls; teach phrase:
"I need private time!" 

#### Handwashing Mastery
