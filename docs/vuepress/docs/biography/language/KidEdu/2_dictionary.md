Sunny Day, Cozy Beds!​

How’s the weather today? Is it sunny or rainy?

"Sunshine, sunshine, warm and bright,
Make my blanket fluffy light!"

Why do blankets love sunshine?" (Kills germs! Makes them smell like "sunshine hugs!").

Ultraviolet rays kill ​dust mites​ and germs! Plus, it makes your duvet ​smell like sunshine hugs.

Let's change the bedding. We take off the dirty sheets and put on the clean ones."
（"我们来换床单，把脏的拆掉，铺上干净的。"）

Help me air out the comforter on the balcony. The sunshine will make it fluffy!"
（"帮我把被子晾在阳台晒一晒，阳光会让它蓬松起来！"）

Let me tuck you in. Don’t kick the blanket off, or you'll get cold!"
（"我给你盖好被子，别踢掉哦，不然会着凉。"）
注：tuck in 指掖被角，具象化动作易被孩子理解。
