云端脚下：从一元二次方程到规范场论

According to Dr. Bruce Lipton, a former medical school professor and research scientist, proteins and signals are fundamental to life: 
Protein plus signal equals behavior
A protein's shape changes when it receives a signal, which is the basis of life. 
Signals activate genes
When a signal enters a cell's nucleus, it activates genes. This means that environmental signals, not genes alone, control genetic activity.
