​Teacher: "Look at this ​cube​! It is a ​3D shape. We can hold it! Now see this ​square​ on paper—it is ​flat. We call it a ​2D shape."

​Child A: "3D shape is fat? 2D shape is flat?"

​Teacher: "Yes! ​3D shapes​ are thick and can be touched. ​2D shapes​ are thin and drawn on paper."

Teacher: "How many ​faces​ does it have?"

​Child A: "Six ​faces​! Each ​face​ is a ​square​!"

​Teacher: "Yes! And how many ​edges​?"

​Child B: "Twelve ​edges​! I count them: one, two, three... twelve!"

​Scene 2: Touching and Comparing Shapes​
​Teacher: "Touch this ​sphere. It is round like a ​circle, but it is a ​3D ball​! The ​circle​ is its ​flat friend."

​Child B: "My ball is 3D! The circle picture is 2D!"

​Teacher: "Smart! Now, what ​2D shape​ is on the ​cube’s face​?"

​Child C: "A ​square​! Each side is a square!"

​Scene 3: Tracing 3D Shapes to Find 2D Shapes​
​Teacher: "Let’s trace the ​cylinder’s bottom. See? It makes a ​circle​ on paper!" 

​Child D: "I trace the ​cone​! It makes a ​circle​ too?"

​Teacher: "The bottom is a ​circle, but the side is a ​triangle​! Trace it—oh, a triangle appears!" 

​Scene 4: Matching Faces to 3D Objects​
​Teacher: "What ​2D shape​ is on the ​pyramid’s bottom?"

​Child E: "A ​square​!"

​Teacher: "And its sides?"

​Child F: "​Triangles​! Pointy triangles!"

​Scene 5: Play with Shape Hunt​
​Teacher: "Find a ​3D shape​ in the room. What ​2D shapes​ hide on its faces?"

​Child G: "I found a ​box​! It has ​squares​ on every side!"

​Child H: "My ​ice cream cone​ has a ​circle​ bottom and ​triangle​ side!"

Scene 2: Comparing 3D Faces to 2D Shapes​
​Teacher: "Now, trace the ​face​ of this ​cylinder. What ​2D shape​ do you see?"

​Child C: "A ​circle​! The top and bottom are ​circles​!"

​Teacher: "Good! How many ​faces​ on a cylinder?"

​Child D: "Three ​faces​! Two ​circles​ and one ​rectangle​!"

​Teacher: "And how many ​edges​?"

​Child E: "Two ​edges​! Around the circles!"
