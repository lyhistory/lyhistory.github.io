3 problems:

+ how to communicate safely => encryption/decryption
+ how to distribute the keys => key management & key exchange
+ how to sign => digital signature

PKI: public key infrastructure (Public-Key Cryptosystems) === Asymmetric Cryptography

DLP: Discrete Logarithm Problem

DHK: Diffie–Hellman key exchange



## Cryptography

block ciphers VS stream ciphers



## Encryption

### Symmetric

Confusions and Diffusions

Theory:  finite field/Galois field/Prime Fields/Extension Fields GF(2<sup>m</sup>)

DES

AES

### Asymmetric

+ based on 大数分解素数

  theory: Euclidean Algorithm / Extended Euclidean Algorithm / Euler's Phi Function / Fermat's Little Theorem and Euler's Theorem

  + RSA

+ based on discrete logarithm
  + DHK
  + Elgamal Encryption
  + ECC

  


## Signature

Theory: hash function(for signing long message)

RSA 

Elgamal 

DSA

ECDSA



## Key Establishment

就是如何发布和管理相关的密钥

+ Symmetric

+ Asymmetric

  Pub key => CA
