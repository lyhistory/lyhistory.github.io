## layer 1 blockchain

Layer 1 is the fundamental base network of a blockchain platform. It executes all on-chain transactions and therefore acts as a public ledgerâ€™s source of truth.

Layer 1 blockchains can validate and finalize transactions without the need for another network. Some examples include: Bitcoin, BSC, Ethereum, Algorand, Cardano, Solana, Fantom.

## layer 2
zkEVM: zkSync

to solve The Trilemma

Layer 2 blockchains build on top of Layer 1 blockchains by allowing them to scale. They typically inherit the security of the Layer 1 blockchain while concentrating resources on providing utility and optimized scalability (Builtin). Examples: Arbitrum, Optimism, ZkSync, StarkNet.

In terms of features, layer 1 solutions typically consist of a network of nodes and block-producing miners, storage of all transaction data, and a consensus mechanism.

## layer 3

Protocol vs. Applications: Layer 2 often involves protocols built on top of the base blockchain, while Layer 3 focuses on real-world applications, including gaming, DeFi, and other services
