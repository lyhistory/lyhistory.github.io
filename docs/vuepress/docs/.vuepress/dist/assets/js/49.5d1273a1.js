This results in a forked history.\nAssume now you have done the development work on feature,  you want to merge it to develop branch: how many options you have: cherry-pick or merge or rebasing+merge\nbecause cherry-pick is not a structured way to do the merge, so I'm not going to discuss it.\nthis is what happens behind the scene when you git merge in command line or use GUI tool.\nit will merge between  C3&C4 and their most recent common ancestor C2 and create a new commit C5\nrebase works by going to the common ancestor of the two branches C2, getting the diff introduced by each commit of feature C4 , saving those diffs to temporary files, resetting feature branch to the same commit as develop (the branch you are rebasing onto), and finally applying each change in turn C4 prime.Now you switch to develop branch, and do git merge, it will do a fast-forward merge.\nbut what will happen if someone updated develop branch in between, I mean between you have done rebase and start to do merge on develop.\nif your purpose is to keep a linear clean commit history on an active branch, rebase can help you .\n \n3. when to use rebase\nBad practice\nrebase develop onto your feature.\nThe problem is that this only happened in your repository. All of the other developers are still working with the original develop. Since rebasing results in brand new commits, Git will think that your develop branchâ€™s history has diverged from everybody elseâ€™s.\nGolden rule - never use it on public branch(Is anyone looking at this branch?)\nGood practice (go to previous slide)\nNow, letâ€™s say that the new commits in develop are relevant to the feature that youâ€™re working on.\nOne typical situation,\nwhen someone has done a hot-fix for master,\nby right, this hot-fix will be merged back to develop branch,\nand you cannot continue with your development without this hot-fix in your feature branch,\nthen you may consider using rebase to get latest from develop\nTo incorporate the new commits into your feature branch,.\nmost of the time you may work solely on one feature branch, but if more than one developer working on same feature branch\nyou want to keep updated with latest changes or you want to keep a clean graph/commit history\nconclusion:\nconflict is inevitable, by adopting appropriate merging strategy, we can mitigate the risk of getting too many conflicts.\nanother suggestion is always examine your current status, which branch you are in,is there any other people working on this branch, and are you behind remote branches or ahead of remote branches with how many commits\nhopefully you may have a better understanding of the merging strategy and understand what happens behind the scene.\nhttps://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing\n1. rebase is in local\nall changes apply onto parent's latest changes\nthen can do the merge\nquestion: 1.how abt someone push new changes to parent branch\n2.before rebase you pushed to remote, cannot do the fast-forward merge\n2. merge in remote - pull request\nlatest changes and common ancestor changes\nA forked commit history\nactive 'parent' branch\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing/conceptual-overview\ngit rebase is good for local cleanup,\nlocal cleanup? team policy?\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/articles/git-team-workflows-merge-or-rebase/\ndon't commit so frequently, like writing 1 line code then commit, other people who commit later will suffer\n \nhttps://steemit.com/bitcoin/@sblue/what-is-git-github-the-3-minute-journey-through-bitcoins-github-history\nhttp://csci221.artifice.cc/lecture/collaboration-with-git.html\n\nhttp://flsilva.com/blog/git-branching-and-merging/\nhttps://longair.net/blog/2009/04/16/git-fetch-and-merge/\n\n# whatâ€™s Git\nGIT stores the state of your application at points in time known as commits. It does this in a clever way that means you don't have to store the whole state of your application, it just records a series of changes.\nIn GIT you have a master branch which (usually) stores the working, production state of your application. You can also create other branches for working on specific things such as features or bug fixes. This allows you and other developers to continue development without affecting the master branch.\nOnce testing is complete, you can merge these branches into your master/production branch. If you are developing a website using GIT, you might have the repository stored on a server somewhere. You can set up a hook in GIT that pushes your master commits to this repository, but no others.\nOne advantage this has over FTP is that GIT will just push the changes and not the files themselves, making uploading new versions a lot quicker.\nGIT, however, has a few other fantastic features. Finding the source of bugs in GIT is extremely easy. It has built in tools for finding where a piece of code stopped working.\n\n# Git vs SVN\nGit is not better than Subversion. But is also not worse. It's different.\nThe key difference is that it is decentralized. Imagine you are a developer on the road, you develop on your laptop and you want to have source control so that you can go back 3 hours.\nWith Subversion, you have a Problem: The SVN Repository may be in a location you can't reach (in your company, and you don't have internet at the moment), you cannot commit. If you want to make a copy of your code, you have to literally copy/paste it.\nWith Git, you do not have this problem. Your local copy is a repository, and you can commit to it and get all benefits of source control. When you regain connectivity to the main repository, you can commit against it.\n# bitcoin team\nTeam\nThe Bitcoin Core project has a large open source developer community with many casual contributors to the codebase. There are many more who contribute research, peer review, testing, documentation, and translation.\nMaintainers\nProject maintainers have commit access and are responsible for merging patches from contributors. They perform a janitorial role merging patches that the team agrees should be merged. They also act as a final check to ensure that patches are safe and in line with the project goals. The maintainersâ€™ role is by agreement of project contributors.\nContributors\nEveryone is free to propose code changes and to test, review and comment on open Pull Requests. Anyone who contributes code, review, test, translation or documentation to the Bitcoin Core project is considered a contributor. The release notes for each Bitcoin Core software release contain a credits section to recognize all those who have contributed to the project over the previous release cycle. A list of code contributors for the last year can be found on Github.\n\n")])])]),a("hr"),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Ref:\nCheatsheet\nhttps://illustrated-git.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\nTake your Git practice to the next level"),a("br"),e._v("\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJyduqGuQ")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
