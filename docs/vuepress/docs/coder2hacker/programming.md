Programming is an important part of being a successful hacker. This isnâ€™t a comprehensive list of programming languages and nearly any can be used for most hacking tasks, especially on the web, but rather a list of languages we find especially useful or notable.

## JavaScript

This is the language used on the majority of web pages. Understanding it is useful for bug hunting because many bugs actually stem from JS code.

Can be used for the same tasks as Python and Ruby (albeit with fewer relevant libraries), but mostly useful to know for analysis of code on the web, as well as exploitation.

## Python and Ruby
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/

Useful for automation and quick testing and analysis, particularly for web hacking.

## Java and Kotlin
The ability to read these will be essential if you plan to do source code review of Android applications. Java is produced by decompilers for Android applications, which allows you to read code (roughly) equivalent to the original source, even when you only have a compiled application.

## SQL

Used by most applications for accessing and manipulating data. Knowledge of SQL will help in discovering and exploiting critical SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

## Objective-C and Swift
The ability to read these will be essential if you plan to do source code review of iOS applications.

## AArch64 assembly

For advanced embedded and mobile hacking, understanding the very lowest level of abstraction is essential.
