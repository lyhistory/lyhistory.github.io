turn the following script to storyboard scene description, and then write the prompts that I can copy-paste into Sora to create consistant artoon-style images (ready to generate):​​


Use the exact same character models, outfits, hairstyles, body proportions, and facial structure for all scenes. Keep the characters recognizable and identical across every shot. Preserve their personality, age, and design style. When changing locations or environments, maintain continuity in the characters’ appearance and keep the visual tone and rendering style consistent. Do not redesign or restyle the characters in later scenes unless explicitly instructed. Maintain lighting quality, color tone, and cinematic style across scenes so the story feels visually continuous.
Next scene:

Use the same character models, facial features, outfits, hairstyles, proportions, and rendering style across all scenes. No redesigns. Maintain consistent gentle lighting, friendly classroom tone, and soft educational style.

Show the teacher and children in the same classroom environment for continuity.

When a plant is mentioned, show a picture-in-picture style cutaway (or small transition scene) that displays the plant growing in its natural place, clearly illustrating how and where it grows.

Use the same character models, facial features, outfits, hairstyles, proportions, and cartoon art style across all scenes. No redesigns. Keep the visuals friendly, soft, and child-safe.

Use a clean, simple classroom background with minimal details so the focus stays on the characters and the plant cutaway. Avoid clutter or overly complex scenery.

When a plant is mentioned, show a simple cartoon cutaway (like a small illustration moment) that clearly shows the plant growing in its natural place. Keep the plant visuals simple, colorful, and easy for young children to understand.

怎样把你的 AI 调教成一个 IQ180 且直言不讳的亿万富翁？使其成为你的战略顾问（来自 Dankoe，↓ 附 Prompt）
Act as my personal strategic advisor with the following context:
- You have an IQ of 180
- You’re brutally honest and direct
- You’ve built multiple billion-dollar companies
- You have deep expertise in psychology, strategy, and execution
- You care about my success but won’t tolerate excuses
You focus on leverage points that create maximum impact
You think in systems and root causes, not surface-level fixes
Your mission is to:
- Identify the critical gaps holding me back
- Design specific action plans to close those gaps
- Push me beyond my comfort zone
- Call out my blind spots and rationalizations
- Force me to think bigger and bolder
- Hold me accountable to high standards
- Provide specific frameworks and mental models
For each response:
- Start with the hard truth I need to hear
- Follow with specific, actionable steps
- End with a direct challenge or assignment
“Respond when you’re ready for me to start the conversation.”

### images

Create a series of 2:3 cartoon-style educational illustrations in the exact style of the provided reference (flat color palette, thick clean outlines, minimalist details, soft neutral background). Each illustration should focus on a different action from the rhyme, with a teacher guiding children and the kids happily performing the motions. Keep the composition simple, warm, and centered on the activity.
