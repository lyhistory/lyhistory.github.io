### What is Rooting?
Rooting is basically giving yourself privileges to access features on your phone which either would be blocked by the carrier or the actual provider of the phone. There are a variety of apps, access to which can only be granted if your phone has root permissions. For example, you can download an advanced screen recorder.


Rooting certain apps will help you increase the battery life (now that’s a lifesaver), make in-app purchases for free, or even increase the speed of your phone’s CPU by overclocking it. In short, a gold mine of apps and an opportunity to enhance your phone experience.

To the people new to rooting, you are in safe hands! To the people who know rooting, how irritating was it to constantly keep rooting/unrooting your phone in order to get OTA updates! Or the inability to use banking applications on your phone? We totally feel you.

People often look for the root cause, we’ll give you a root solution (quite literally) to every feature you’ve wished for, on your phone!.


Magisk is a systemless rooting system. This basically means that you can modify your phone’s system without making any changes to the core code. Magisk was developed by Topjohnwu and launched in the year 2016, and since then has been widening its horizons with each passing year. Magisk Root is a boon especially when it comes to running the financial applications.

If you want you can also install YouTube Vanced Manager using Magisk which helps users to run YouTube without ads.

Let’s understand what is Magisk with an example.

Suppose you want to run a banking application. But whenever you open the application you get the notification that says something like “Your phone isn’t rooted and you won’t be able to use this application on your device”.

Now, to run that application, you may choose to unroot your phone, work on that app, and re-root your phone using Chainfire SuperSU. But rooting and unrooting your device is a lengthy process. You may do it once but doing it repeatedly will surely feel tedious.

What if you want to use that banking application urgently? You don’t want to be stuck unrooting your phone. With Magisk, you can make changes to run the application.

Here are some features:

+ Magisk allows you to pass Google’s safety tests (Safety net).
+ This open-source software allows you to add and modify files without any issues. If you know to code and want to make some changes to the default coding, you can do so.
+ Magisk Mount feature will make changes to the core and partition level without any issues. You can divide your system, core files, and other media files and store them anywhere in the memory storage.
+ Resetprop feature, in this you can make changes to your system prop files including read-only files. You can attempt changes in the build.
+ Magisk can be downloaded on a non-rooted phone and it can help you to root your phone.


Earlier there used to be different files for Magisk where you had to download the .zip file and then also download the app which was a time-consuming process.

Now, with the help of the Magisk App, you can easily install Magisk by renaming the .apk file to the .zip file. If you wish to uninstall the Magisk app then you just need to rename the app to uninstall.zip and that’s pretty much it.


What is the use of the Magisk App?
If you want to grant/deny permission for any application, this can be easily done with the help of Magisk App. There are a ton of free modules available on Magisk App, from them you can download apps and games to your Android device. And the plus point is, you can add your own or custom repositories to get stuff from.

Caution: Make sure that you take a complete backup of your Android device before following this procedure.
