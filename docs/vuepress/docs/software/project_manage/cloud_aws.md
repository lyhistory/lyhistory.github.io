## VPC
### Basics for creating an Internet-connected VPC
1. Choosing an address range
Recommended: RFC1918 range /16(64K addresses) 172.31.0.0/16 (avoid ranges that overlap with other networks to which you might connect)
2. Setting up subnets in Availability Zones
Recommended: /24 subnets(251 addresses)
example: one subnet per Availability Zone:
Availability Zone 1: 172.31.0.0/24
Availability Zone 2: 172.31.1.0/24
Availability Zone 3: 172.31.2.0/24

3. Creating a route to the Internet
+ Route tables contain rules for which packets go where
+ Your VPC has a default route table
+ but you can assign different route tables to different subnets
example:
```
default:
Destination     Target
172.31.0.0/16   local

after create internet gateway:
Destination     Target
172.31.0.0/16   local
0.0.0.0/0       igw-xxxxxx
```

4. Authorizing traffic to/from the VPC
+ Network ACLs = stateless firewall rules
+ Security groups = stateful firewall

### More scenarios

+ non-internet facing VPC access the internet by routing to NAT in the internet facing VPC
+ VPC Peering
    1. Initiate peering request
    2. Accept peering request
    3. create routes
+ Extend your own network to VPC
    - VPN
    - Direct Connect
    
## The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

The AWS CLI v2 offers several new features including improved installers, new configuration options such as AWS Single Sign-On (SSO), and various interactive features. 

All IaaS (infrastructure as a service) AWS administration, management, and access functions in the AWS Management Console are available in the AWS API and AWS CLI.

The AWS CLI provides direct access to the public APIs of AWS services. You can explore a service's capabilities with the AWS CLI, and develop shell scripts to manage your resources. In addition to the low-level, API-equivalent commands, several AWS services provide customizations for the AWS CLI.
