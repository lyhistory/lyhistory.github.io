session id

A PHP Session ID is a unique, random string generated by PHP to track individual users across different pages of a website, allowing the server to "remember" user-specific data (like login status or shopping cart items). It is stored as a cookie in the user's browser, by default called PHPSESSID. 

Is it automatic for all PHP websites?
No, it is not always "auto" in the sense that it starts on its own. While PHP is capable of generating it automatically, a session generally requires a session_start() function call in the code to initiate. Once initiated, PHP manages the ID automatically. 

Is it automatic in WordPress?
No, WordPress does not use standard PHP sessions (and therefore not the PHPSESSID cookie) by default. 
Why: WordPress was designed to avoid PHP sessions to ensure better caching and performance, as unique session IDs break page caching.
How WordPress handles sessions: Instead of $_SESSION, WordPress uses cookies and database-backed session tokens (stored in wp_usermeta) to manage user sessions and login states.
When it is used: If a plugin or theme calls session_start(), then a PHP session will be created, but this is not native behavior.
