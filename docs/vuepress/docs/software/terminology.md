First, we accessed Local Storage from an application different from the one that added the storage, but in the same domain. To do that, we used window.localStorage.MessageOfTheDay, taking the key value as the object name and referencing it directly as a member of Local Storage. For the Session Storage, we had to move to the window that created the storage and exploit a vulnerability there; here, we used a different instruction to get the value we wanted: window.sessionStorage.getItem("Secure.AuthenticationToken". Both forms (key as a member of the class and getItem) are valid for both types of storage. We used getItem in the session because the key includes a period (.), and this would be processed as an object/property delimiter by the JavaScript interpreter, so we needed to use getItem to enclose it in colons.
