please brief the tcp/ip model (OR the Open Systems Interconnection model )
https://lyhistory.com/docs/software/network/network.html#_1-%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E5%88%86%E5%B1%82-tcp-ip%E5%8D%8F%E8%AE%AE%E7%BB%84

could you name some of the typical protocols for the top 3 layer（application/transport/network）

do you know why TCP uses 4 way finishing connection termination instead of 3 way like the establishment handshake?

explain the difference between HTTP and HTTTPS

which layer does the tls/ssl work on

does TLS handshake happen after or before TCP handshake?

what problems does microservices arcthitecture bring in and how can we solve them

could you give me some examples of how microservices communicated with each other
