North Korea (officially known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, or DPRK) has owned the title of “Most Worthless Government on Earth” for decades. It owes that title to many things; one of them is its monopoly on the information to which its citizens have access. (Others include things like imprisoning and executing dissidents.)

I will still be going through important points on these topics, the rest of the Day 2 lesson time will be used for in-class discussions.
I will also be spending some time to discuss the scenario for the first individual assignment and specific areas which are out of scope for the examination during Day 2 lesson.</p> <p>Survey of benefits perceived from systems architecture among 86 respoinding organizations.
Solution Architecture commonly describes the components required for and end-to-end solution, tying together patterns from more than one domain.
A Solution Architect may shield the Enterprise/Segment Architect from the unnecessary details of the systems, products, and/or technologies.
Detailed Design is representing sufficient details for implementing the system.
Good object oriented design practices also apply at architectural level.
The Architect defines solutions to client business problems through the reasoned application of information technology.These solutions are manifested as architectures and can include systems, applications and process components.
Architecture is the organization of components, its relationship to each other and to the environment, governed by the principles.
Modularity is the degree to which a system or computer program is composed of discrete components such that a change to one component has minimal impact on other components
Competitive pressure and short window of opportunity
Efficiency: resource expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness with which users achieve goals
Each tier acts as a server for its caller and client to the next tier in the architecture.
NoSQL can be strong or eventual consistency.
Records the significant decisions made in shaping the overall architecture, and describes the rationale used in making the decision, the options considered, and the implications of the decision. Focus on high impact, high priority areas that are in strong alignment with the business strategy.

Integrity: protecting the 'accuracy' of information processing and data from improper modification
Confidentiality: Protecting the secrecy and privacy of information
Availability: Ensuring that the systems and data can be accessed when required
Structure a system so that all access by clients to resources is mediated by a guard which enforces a security policy.

The images circulating on Facebook since Wednesday evening show the girl’s right leg being chained to a pole while her school bag and water bottle are left lying on the ground beside her.
It was not immediately clear if she had been left there by a parent or guardian, and for how long.
Netizens were quick to condemn the act, with many of them blaming the girl’s parents for resorting to such measures to punish their child.

The customer had signed the proposal to indicate acceptance.
start off
In MAXWARE, the design stage is very informal. More often design specifications are produced only for major and critical modules. Review of the design specifications are done by the senior development staff, who have more experience. The design specifications are then handed over to the programmers to start the coding. &quot;We can do well even without design as long as we trust our engineers and programmers...&quot;, say the development managers, whenever there is an issue or comment about practicing more formal and disciplined design process. Some of the other reasons given are: short development time and attitude of some team members towards additional work and responsibility.
There are no software testing tools employed other than some test programs written and/or modified by the programmers themselves.
In an incident, the software system crashed and was disrupted necessitating a re-build of the system. When the build was completed and released to the customer, he reported some more bugs. It was realized that these bugs had previously been rectified.
In that short time, she managed to tighten up the process for handling field reported incidents and the consequential resolution of defects.
The users could not articulate their needs and the analysts had to evolve them through working models created with the developers to help the users visualize the use of the system.
Unconventionally, the Requirements, Architecture and Design phases were by-passed. The scope of the project was based solely on the working model to represent the user's needs. The PM told the Systems Testing group to derive their test plans and test cases using the working model in lieu of the requirements and design documents.
The situation was exacerbated by the continuous stream of changes to the requirements. Unknown to the analysts and developers, the users held several sessions amongst themselves to further orientate themselves to the working model.
Fortunately, the QM maintained rigorously tracking of all defects, including the classification and characterization of each.
Testing the first iteration had been a significant struggle for the System Testers. Most defects were due to ambiguous requirements or undocumented requirements that crept in through the emails
On average, for the same class severity defects, the rework effort and defect turnaround speed for the second iteration was almost triple that of what was registered in the first iteration. In essence, the actual application developed up to that point was far from what had been written in the test plan and test cases for the project.
Everything turned out well in the end.
There are still occasional high severity defects, but many more are minor ones now.</p> <p>///
This prototype is for demonstrating our high level architecture which is designed by Mr.Jagdish,
and contributed by all of our team members.
The Use Case we pick up is 'Purchase Product', for this is one of the most complicated one.
For Presentation we chose to use MVC Framework,because by using MVC we can fast adopting multiple features
like URL routing/session management/authentication and authorization etc., for view engine we use razor,
which can set master layout/partial layout, make our live much easier.
OK, now I show you the demo, first as a guest or before you login to the website, it's allowed to add any items

but you must login to proceed payment, now I login using an existing account,
let's continue to proceed payment, you are request to provide delivery address, next time this address will
be list down for you to choose, ok, submit, we are redirecting to pay-pal merchant payment page, as we are
using sandbox to test, let me key-in test account,
Now we are succeed, now we can go to member center to check our order</p> <h2 id="anecdote"><a href="#anecdote" class="header-anchor">#</a> Anecdote</h2> <p>“Do not shop at Mustafa Shopping Centre”
Me and my husband visited Singapore in March 08. I had earlier visited Singapore some 4-5 years back and I knew that Singapore is a shopping heaven. So I had Mustafa on my list.
We decided to buy Mobiles for us and we zeroed in on Mustafa after reading soooo many good reviews about it.We decided on the models and headed to Mustafa. I was actually surprised on how bad the place has turned out to be..lots of people were in the shop..the salesperson was unaware about the mobile features.We asked whether they will give us International Guarantee of these mobiles for which they refused. The place looked shady..But with good reviews on various forums we shirked all our doubts and went ahead and shopped the mobiles. All good..we returned home and started using the mobiles. My mobile worked fine for few days after which it hangs while I am talking..sometimes it refuses to ring even when I get calls..sometimes it refuses to make me ring a missed call..sometimes it simply blanks out!! The memory chip place holder is loose and so is the SIM holder place...My husbands mobile has similar problems.
So I would suggest that if someone is planning to shop in Mustafa its better you have good know how of the thing you are buying so that you dont feel cheated and if you dont have the know how then the best thing you can do is not to buy at all from there!
