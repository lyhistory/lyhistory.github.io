You must first of all obtain a list of all the sub-areas contained within specified area(including all their sub-areas, and so on for all levels of containment)
Although the links between objects may be duplicated, introducing some redundancy, it is useful if traversal of the hierarchy has to take place in both direction, i.e. if it necessary to be able to go from a child to its parents as well as from a parent to its children. Possible problem is loss of consistency(i.e. A links to B but not vice versa), due to programming/maintenance errors.

不可逆 irrevocably sealed
隔离 绝缘 insulate
Database interactions should be encapsulated within private methods, insulating the consumer from the details of the database and its associated tables.
A factory is the location of a concrete class in the code at which objects are constructed. The intent in employing the pattern is to insulate the creation of objects from their usage and to create families of related objects without having to depend on their concrete classes.
隔离 孤立isolate
The Repository pattern helps to isolate both the service and the list access code. Isolation makes it easier to treat them as independent services and to replace them with mock objects in unit tests.

objects embody the runtime dynamisms
object-oriented system is a system which is made out of dynamic objects,which delivers a solution through
collaborations.
Designing and developing an OO System involves Abstraction - the process of defining objects.
Real world objects are transformed into an automated world comprising the software equivalents of the real world objects.
Extracting relevant characteristics of real world objects into software objects.
OO Misconceptions
Many still think OO means programming in OO programming languages,but programming issues are only a part
in relation to larger issues of OO analysis,design and management.
Software engineering involves more things than programming languages,it involves planning, requirements
gathering, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance etc.
Needs for development methodology and good understanding of fundamental concepts of OO,involves achieving
best practices through leveraging on the fundamental concepts of OO.
descendent ancestor
Polymorphism is the most powerful OO feature, the ability to manipulate different objects that have a common set of operations which can be
enforced via an interface or a superclass.
Supports plug-and-run benefits, allowing plugging of objects of different classes as long as that the objects
conform to the interface required,allow a more flexible reuse of code by plugging any object that meets the
minimum requirement for the job.

The power of d3.js and its flexibility, comes at the expense of its steep learning curve. There are some libraries built on top of it that provide numerous off-the-shelf charts in order to make the users’ life easier, however, learning to work with d3.js is essential sometimes, especially when you need to create sophisticated and custom visualisations.
If you are not familiar with d3.js, you can read this introduction. In brief, just like jQuery and other DOM manipulation frameworks, it allows you to dynamically manipulate the properties and attributes of your HTML document elements. Nevertheless, it doesn’t stop here. Its power comes from two additional functionality. It can also create and manipulate SVG elements, and it can also bind the DOM or SVG elements to arrays of data, so that any changes in that data will be reflected on those elements they are binded to. There are numerous SVG shapes, such as circles, rectangles, paths and texts. Those shapes serve as the building blocks of your visualisations. For example, a bar chart is composed of multiple rectangles. while a scatter plot is made of circles scattered in different parts of you drawing area. You may also want to see this interactive tutorial about creating and manipulation SVG elements, as well as binding them to data arrays. - See more at: http://schoolofdata.org/2013/10/01/pie-and-donut-charts-in-d3-js</h2> <p>The system shall be capable of performing optimally when the following are simultaneously using the system performing typical tasks.

Drag an Assign activity from the Primitives section of the Toolbox and drop onto the Exit section of the state.
Type Turns into the To box and Turns + 1 into the Enter a C# expression or Enter a VB expression box.
Return to the overall state machine view in the workflow designer by clicking StateMachine in the breadcrumb display at the top of the workflow designer.
Drag a FinalState activity from the State Machine section of the Toolbox, hover it over the Enter Guess state, and drop it onto the triangle that appears to the right of the Enter Guess state so that a transition is created between Enter Guess and FinalState.
The default name of the transition is T2. Click the transition in the workflow designer to select it, and set its DisplayName to Guess Correct. Then click and select the FinalState, and drag it to the right so that there is room for the full transition name to be displayed without overlaying either of the two states. This will make it easier to complete the remaining steps in the tutorial.
Double-click the newly renamed Guess Correct transition in the workflow designer to expand it.
Drag a ReadInt activity from the NumberGuessWorkflowActivities section of the Toolbox and drop it in the Trigger section of the transition.
In the Properties Window for the ReadInt activity, type &quot;EnterGuess&quot; including the quotes into the BookmarkName property value box, and type Guess into the Result property value box
Type the following expression into the Guess Correct transition’s Condition property value box.

data capture - the action or process of gathering data, especially from an automatic device, control system, or sensor.
data dump - a large amount of data transferred from one system or location to another.
data replication - is the frequent electronic copying data from a database in one computer or server to a database in another so that all users share the same level of information. The result is a distributed database in which users can access data relevant to their tasks without interfering with the work of others.
dummy data - In Informatics, dummy data is benign information that does not contain any useful data, but serves to reserve space where real data is nominally present. Dummy data can be used as a placeholder for both testing and operational purposes.
The Manual system is slow to operate and has resulted in either inadequate stocks of furniture being available to meet demand, or excessive stocks of furniture being built up.
