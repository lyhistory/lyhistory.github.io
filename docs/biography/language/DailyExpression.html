It is strongly recommended that the graduate be dressed in white top and black bottom, in order for the attire to complement the faculty hood. For males who are not gowned, please be dressed in a jacket, light-colored long-sleeved shirt and black pants. Female who are not gowned should be dressed in your best bright outfit.

speculate vs hedge vs invest vs infer
The main purpose of speculation, on the other hand, is to profit from betting on the direction in which an asset will be moving. Hedgers reduce their risk by taking an opposite position in the market to what they are trying to hedge.
The main difference between speculating and investing is the amount of of risk undertaken in the trade. Typically, high-risk trades that are almost akin to gambling fall under the umbrella of speculation, whereas lower-risk investments based on fundamentals and analysis fall into the category of investing.
As verbs the difference between speculate and infer is that speculate is to think, meditate or reflect on a subject; to consider, to deliberate or cogitate while infer is to introduce (something) as a reasoned conclusion; to conclude by reasoning or deduction, as from premises or evidence.</p> <h3 id="about-house"><a href="#about-house" class="header-anchor">#</a> About house</h3> <p>餐具室 pantry

North Korea (officially known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, or DPRK) has owned the title of “Most Worthless Government on Earth” for decades. It owes that title to many things; one of them is its monopoly on the information to which its citizens have access. (Others include things like imprisoning and executing dissidents.)

Me and my husband visited Singapore in March 08. I had earlier visited Singapore some 4-5 years back and I knew that Singapore is a shopping heaven. So I had Mustafa on my list.
We decided to buy Mobiles for us and we zeroed in on Mustafa after reading soooo many good reviews about it.We decided on the models and headed to Mustafa. I was actually surprised on how bad the place has turned out to be..lots of people were in the shop..the salesperson was unaware about the mobile features.We asked whether they will give us International Guarantee of these mobiles for which they refused. The place looked shady..But with good reviews on various forums we shirked all our doubts and went ahead and shopped the mobiles. All good..we returned home and started using the mobiles. My mobile worked fine for few days after which it hangs while I am talking..sometimes it refuses to ring even when I get calls..sometimes it refuses to make me ring a missed call..sometimes it simply blanks out!! The memory chip place holder is loose and so is the SIM holder place...My husbands mobile has similar problems.
So I would suggest that if someone is planning to shop in Mustafa its better you have good know how of the thing you are buying so that you dont feel cheated and if you dont have the know how then the best thing you can do is not to buy at all from there!

Solution Architecture commonly describes the components required for and end-to-end solution, tying together patterns from more than one domain.
A Solution Architect may shield the Enterprise/Segment Architect from the unnecessary details of the systems, products, and/or technologies.
Detailed Design is representing sufficient details for implementing the system.
Good object oriented design practices also apply at architectural level.
The Architect defines solutions to client business problems through the reasoned application of information technology.These solutions are manifested as architectures and can include systems, applications and process components.
Architecture is the organization of components, its relationship to each other and to the environment, governed by the principles.
Modularity is the degree to which a system or computer program is composed of discrete components such that a change to one component has minimal impact on other components
Competitive pressure and short window of opportunity
Efficiency: resource expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness with which users achieve goals
Each tier acts as a server for its caller and client to the next tier in the architecture.
NoSQL can be strong or eventual consistency.
Records the significant decisions made in shaping the overall architecture, and describes the rationale used in making the decision, the options considered, and the implications of the decision. Focus on high impact, high priority areas that are in strong alignment with the business strategy.

The images circulating on Facebook since Wednesday evening show the girl’s right leg being chained to a pole while her school bag and water bottle are left lying on the ground beside her.
It was not immediately clear if she had been left there by a parent or guardian, and for how long.
Netizens were quick to condemn the act, with many of them blaming the girl’s parents for resorting to such measures to punish their child.

Before we jump in, I need to define two important terms</p> <p>the idea is
I am thinking
the whole point is
just a few cool new things to look out for</p> <h2 id="analysis"><a href="#analysis" class="header-anchor">#</a> Analysis</h2> <p>误：I think I can't.
正：I don't think I can.
提示：汉语里说“我想我不会”的时候，英语里面总是说“我不认为我会”。以后在说类似的英语句子的时候，只要留心，也会习惯英语的表达习惯的。
误：I don't dance well too.
正：I am not a very good dancer either.
提示：当我们说不擅长做什么事情的时候，英语里面通常用not good at something，英语的思维甚至直接跳跃到：我不是一个好的舞者。
误：I have something to do tomorrow.
正：I am tied up all day tomorrow.
提示：用I have something to do来表示很忙，这也完全是中国式的说法。因为每时每刻我们都有事情要做，躺在那里睡大觉也是事情。所以可以说我很忙，脱不开身：I'm tied up。还有其它的说法：I can't make it at that time. I'd love to, but I can't, I have to stay at home.
误：Would you like to join our party on Friday?
正：Would you like to come to our party on Friday night?
提示：join往往是指参加俱乐部或者协会，如：join a health club; join the Communist Party。事实上，常常与party搭配的动词是come 或者go。如go a wild party，或者come to a Christmas Party。
误：I have no experience.
正：I don't know much about that.
提示：I have no experience这句话听起来古里古怪，因为只需要说那方面我懂得不多，或者这方面我不在行，就行了。I am not really an expert in this area。
--Will you be going back home for the Spring Festival?
误：--Of course!
正：--Sure. / Certainly.
提示：以英语为母语的人使用of course的频率要比中国的学生低得多，只有在回答一些众所周知的问题时才说of course。因为of course后面隐含的一句话是“我当然知道啦！难道我是一个傻瓜吗？”因此，of course带有挑衅的意味。在交谈时，用sure或certainly效果会好得多。同时，of course not也具挑衅的意味。正常情况下语气温和的说法是certainly not。
误：The price is very suitable for me.
正：The price is right.
提示：suitable(合适的、相配的)最常见的用法是以否定的形式出现在告示或通知上，如：下列节目儿童不宜。The following programme is not suitable for children.</p> <p>Is saying &quot;Noted&quot; a rude answer?

100 WAYS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION “HOW ARE YOU?”
&quot;it's not working&quot; and &quot;it doesn't work&quot;</p> <p>How are you? Good or well
https://www.businessinsider.com/how-are-you-im-good-is-acceptable-reply-2014-2/?IR=T</p> <p>No worries
is an expression seen in Australian English, British English and New Zealand English meaning &quot;do not worry about that&quot;, &quot;that's all right&quot;, or &quot;sure thing&quot;. It is similar to the English no problem.</p> <p>what happens what happened what has happened
In the sentences below, the pronoun 'it' functions as an object, not as a subject. Objects do not agree in number with (what appear to be) verbs:</p> <ol><li>I will make it happens.</li> <li>You should let it happens.</li> <li>I will make it happen.</li> <li>You should let it happen.<br>
Below, the word 'he' functions as a subject, and so the verb agrees in number with its subject:</li> <li>I wish (that) he succeeds.  &lt;but the semantics seem awkward to me; shouldn't it be 'I hope'?&gt;</li> <li>I wish (that) he succeed.<br>
what happened vs what has happened

He said that he was tired
He said he has no feeling of me
He didn't do what he said he did
He has done what he said he would do
he said he had done with me
You should have some way to assess how the work being done
Go to where the actual work is being done

extend reading: to doing sth，此时to是介词，有很多常用搭配
2.will do VS will be doing
SLA said it will not be giving the club an alternative site for another golf course, but may offer it another area for social uses.
[box title=&quot;http://bulo.hujiang.com/question/293589/&quot;]
will do 简单陈述将来要发生的动作; 而will be doing则强调将来发生这种动作的状态，及在此状态或背景下可能发生的其它动作。
The train will arrive in a few minutes. 一般将来时，仅指火车几分钟就要到达的客观事实
The train will be arriving in a few minutes. 将来进行时，指火车几分钟后到站的那种状态，可暗含做好准备上车，接人什么的意味。 如： The train will be arriving in a few minutes, let's be ready to get on board.
对比：
I will study English = 陈述将来的一个事实，将来的某个时间我会学英语。
I will be studying English =我在学习英语的时候，可能有其它事情发生。如: I will be studying English when you come to pick me up.

The customer had signed the proposal to indicate acceptance.
start off
In MAXWARE, the design stage is very informal. More often design specifications are produced only for major and critical modules. Review of the design specifications are done by the senior development staff, who have more experience. The design specifications are then handed over to the programmers to start the coding. &quot;We can do well even without design as long as we trust our engineers and programmers...&quot;, say the development managers, whenever there is an issue or comment about practicing more formal and disciplined design process. Some of the other reasons given are: short development time and attitude of some team members towards additional work and responsibility.
There are no software testing tools employed other than some test programs written and/or modified by the programmers themselves.
In an incident, the software system crashed and was disrupted necessitating a re-build of the system. When the build was completed and released to the customer, he reported some more bugs. It was realized that these bugs had previously been rectified.
In that short time, she managed to tighten up the process for handling field reported incidents and the consequential resolution of defects.
The users could not articulate their needs and the analysts had to evolve them through working models created with the developers to help the users visualize the use of the system.
Unconventionally, the Requirements, Architecture and Design phases were by-passed. The scope of the project was based solely on the working model to represent the user's needs. The PM told the Systems Testing group to derive their test plans and test cases using the working model in lieu of the requirements and design documents.
The situation was exacerbated by the continuous stream of changes to the requirements. Unknown to the analysts and developers, the users held several sessions amongst themselves to further orientate themselves to the working model.
Fortunately, the QM maintained rigorously tracking of all defects, including the classification and characterization of each.
Testing the first iteration had been a significant struggle for the System Testers. Most defects were due to ambiguous requirements or undocumented requirements that crept in through the emails
On average, for the same class severity defects, the rework effort and defect turnaround speed for the second iteration was almost triple that of what was registered in the first iteration. In essence, the actual application developed up to that point was far from what had been written in the test plan and test cases for the project.
Everything turned out well in the end.
There are still occasional high severity defects, but many more are minor ones now.</p> <p>///
This prototype is for demonstrating our high level architecture which is designed by Mr.Jagdish,
and contributed by all of our team members.
The Use Case we pick up is 'Purchase Product', for this is one of the most complicated one.
For Presentation we chose to use MVC Framework,because by using MVC we can fast adopting multiple features
like URL routing/session management/authentication and authorization etc., for view engine we use razor,
which can set master layout/partial layout, make our live much easier.
