To do that, we used window.localStorage.MessageOfTheDay, taking the key value as the object name and referencing it directly as a member of Local Storage. For the Session Storage, we had to move to the window that created the storage and exploit a vulnerability there; here, we used a different instruction to get the value we wanted: window.sessionStorage.getItem("Secure.AuthenticationToken". Both forms (key as a member of the class and getItem) are valid for both types of storage. We used getItem in the session because the key includes a period (.), and this would be processed as an object/property delimiter by the JavaScript interpreter, so we needed to use getItem to enclose it in colons.')]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Open-source intelligence (OSINT)")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs, for short)\nhttps://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/vlans-sysadmins-basics")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("ROM RAM(DRAM, SRAM)\nhttps://blog.csdn.net/hcx25909/article/details/7103205")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Technology agnostic")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("NICs (network interface cards)\nNIO non-blocking IO")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Discretionary access control\nmandatory access control")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("ocr optical character recognition\nhttps://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("command palette 命令输入框")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
