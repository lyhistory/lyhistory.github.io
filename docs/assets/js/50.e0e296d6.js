Children can start making connections between words and images on a page.While unloading the dryer:“Can you find all the socks and count them?iir While playing dress-up: "Why did you choose that costume?" or "Can you turn your doll upside down?\nHow about right side up?"\nWhile reading:"l see a boat.

More than anything, it'simportant to make sure children feel successful and confdent throughout the day. in Motivated Minds, Deborah Stipekoutlines three primary components of success for children: competence, autonomy, and care and connection.Competence: Children feel capable when presented with developmentally appropriate tasks that they areTEexcited to do. Follow tasks with specifc and positive feedback like, \"Wow! You put all the toys in the bucket. Great job!'. Autonomy: lf your child has trouble getting started with activities or tasks, give them choices. You can set themup with their chosen activity, a prompt, and a time expectation:\"l will be gone for 10 minutes,l want to knowhow high you can make your tower!\" Follow the autonomous activity with time together.Care and connection: Listen, observe, and acknowledge your child. Sometimes, all your child needs is yourpresence. When you've set up an independent task for them, check back in with them after time is up to seewhat they did. Ask kids questions about their day with specifc prompts, like \"What part of the day was yourorange’(sweet), and what part of the day was your 'lemon'(sour)?\"")]),t._v("
