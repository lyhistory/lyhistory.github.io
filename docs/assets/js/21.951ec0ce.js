The place looked shady..But with good reviews on various forums we shirked all our doubts and went ahead and shopped the mobiles. All good..we returned home and started using the mobiles. My mobile worked fine for few days after which it hangs while I am talking..sometimes it refuses to ring even when I get calls..sometimes it refuses to make me ring a missed call..sometimes it simply blanks out!! The memory chip place holder is loose and so is the SIM holder place...My husbands mobile has similar problems.\nSo I would suggest that if someone is planning to shop in Mustafa its better you have good know how of the thing you are buying so that you dont feel cheated and if you dont have the know how then the best thing you can do is not to buy at all from there!\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2139541-r17779786-Mustafa_Centre-Singapore.html#")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=s.exports}}]);
