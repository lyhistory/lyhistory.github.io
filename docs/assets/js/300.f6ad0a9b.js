For example, we have an object that has a getter method that retrieves a list of Strings, but we have to go to the database to retrieve this list. If there's a proxy, the caller simply invokes this getter method on the proxy object, and the proxy verifies whether the target object already has the list. If not, it goes to the database, retrieves the list, sets it on the target object and returns to the caller. Therefore, the proxy object can execute code before and after the code of the actual targeted object.")])]),e._v(" "),a("p",[a("em",[e._v("The original idea of the Business Delegate was to abstract the presentation layer from knowing how to look EJB objects up.
