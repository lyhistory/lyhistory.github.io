However, its price makes it difficult to justify.\nHopper: This is a fantastic, low-cost disassembler and decompiler that runs on macOS and Linux. While it's no replacement for IDA, it is a great choice for most applications.\nBinary Ninja: Another low-cost alternative to IDA. Its API is perhaps the most powerful of the three for automating analysis of code.\nRadare2: This is a set of tools for doing analysis of binaries. It includes everything from disassembly to debugging and more.\nPE Explorer: This is a great tool for analyzing the PE binaries used on Windows. It allows for exploration of the structures of the executable itself, as well as resources.\ndotPeek: A powerful decompiler for .NET assemblies.\nPEiD: Tool for detecting cryptors, packers, and encryption routines in Windows PE binaries.\nUnicorn Engine: This is a library rather than a standalone tool, but it makes writing quick emulators a breeze. Particularly useful for reverse-engineering.\namerican fuzzy lop: AFL is an extremely powerful fuzzer, enabling detection of complicated bugs in many applications and libraries.\nBinwalk: Used for firmware analysis and extraction. This is primarily useful for embedded Linux devices.\nGNU strings: Finds strings in arbitrary binaries. While not strictly for reverse-engineering, it is among the most useful tools around.\nHxD (Windows) 0xED (macOS): These are graphical hex editors, useful for analysis and manipulation of files and block devices.\nQEMU: An emulator and virtual machine supporting a large number of systems/architectures. This makes it useful for things like running embedded firmware, but also includes debugging facilities that make it an optimal tool for hacking.
