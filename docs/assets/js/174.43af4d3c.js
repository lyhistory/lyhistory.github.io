Just skip over the lines that start with the '%' sign - those are instructive comments.\nWe'll write these three lines of code by inspecting the equation on Page 5 of ex1.pdf\nThe first line of code will compute a vector 'h' containing all of the hypothesis values - one for each training example (i.e. for each row of X).\nThe hypothesis (also called the prediction) is simply the product of X and theta. So your first line of code is…\nh = {multiply X and theta, in the proper order that the inner    dimensions match}\nSince X is size (m x n) and theta is size (n x 1), you arrange the order of operators so the result is size (m x 1).\nThe second line of code will compute the difference between the hypothesis and y - that's the error for each training example. Difference means subtract.\nerror = {the difference between h and y}\nThe third line of code will compute the square of each of those error terms (using element-wise exponentiation),\nAn example of using element-wise exponentiation - try this in your workspace command line so you see how it works.\nv = [-2 3]\nv_sqr = v.^2\nSo, now you should compute the squares of the error terms:\nerror_sqr = {use what you have learned}\nNext, here's an example of how the sum function works (try this from your command line)\nq = sum([1 2 3])\nNow, we'll finish the last two steps all in one line of code. You need to compute the sum of the error_sqr vector, and scale the result (multiply) by 1/(2"),n("em",[e._v("m). That completed sum is the cost value J.\nJ = {multiply 1/(2")]),e._v('m) times the sum of the error_sqr vector}\nThat\'s it. If you run the ex1.m script (by entering the command "ex1" in the console), you should have the correct value for J. Then you should test further by running the additional Test Cases (available via the Resources menu).\nImportant Note: You cannot test your computeCost() function by simply entering "computeCost" or "computeCost()" in the console. The function requires that you pass it three data parameters (X, y, and theta). The "ex1" script does this for you.\nThen you can run the "submit" script, and hopefully it will pass.\nNote: Be sure that every line of code ends with a semicolon. That will suppress the output of any values to the workspace. Leaving out the semicolons will surely make the grader unhappy.')]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("============")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("ex2\nNote: If you are using MATLAB version R2015a or later, the fminunc() function has been changed in this version.
