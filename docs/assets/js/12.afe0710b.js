More often design specifications are produced only for major and critical modules. Review of the design specifications are done by the senior development staff, who have more experience. The design specifications are then handed over to the programmers to start the coding. "We can do well even without design as long as we trust our engineers and programmers...", say the development managers, whenever there is an issue or comment about practicing more formal and disciplined design process. Some of the other reasons given are: short development time and attitude of some team members towards additional work and responsibility.\nThere are no software testing tools employed other than some test programs written and/or modified by the programmers themselves.\nIn an incident, the software system crashed and was disrupted necessitating a re-build of the system. When the build was completed and released to the customer, he reported some more bugs. It was realized that these bugs had previously been rectified.\nIn that short time, she managed to tighten up the process for handling field reported incidents and the consequential resolution of defects.\nThe users could not articulate their needs and the analysts had to evolve them through working models created with the developers to help the users visualize the use of the system.\nUnconventionally, the Requirements, Architecture and Design phases were by-passed. The scope of the project was based solely on the working model to represent the user\'s needs. The PM told the Systems Testing group to derive their test plans and test cases using the working model in lieu of the requirements and design documents.\nThe situation was exacerbated by the continuous stream of changes to the requirements. Unknown to the analysts and developers, the users held several sessions amongst themselves to further orientate themselves to the working model.\nFortunately, the QM maintained rigorously tracking of all defects, including the classification and characterization of each.\nTesting the first iteration had been a significant struggle for the System Testers. Most defects were due to ambiguous requirements or undocumented requirements that crept in through the emails\nOn average, for the same class severity defects, the rework effort and defect turnaround speed for the second iteration was almost triple that of what was registered in the first iteration. In essence, the actual application developed up to that point was far from what had been written in the test plan and test cases for the project.\nEverything turned out well in the end.\nThere are still occasional high severity defects, but many more are minor ones now.')]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("///\nThis prototype is for demonstrating our high level architecture which is designed by Mr.Jagdish,\nand contributed by all of our team members.\nThe Use Case we pick up is 'Purchase Product', for this is one of the most complicated one.\nFor Presentation we chose to use MVC Framework,because by using MVC we can fast adopting multiple features\nlike URL routing/session management/authentication and authorization etc., for view engine we use razor,\nwhich can set master layout/partial layout, make our live much easier.\nOK, now I show you the demo, first as a guest or before you login to the website, it's allowed to add any items\ninto your shopping cart,(show the process,)\nbut you must login to proceed payment, now I login using an existing account,\nlet's continue to proceed payment, you are request to provide delivery address, next time this address will\nbe list down for you to choose, ok, submit, we are redirecting to pay-pal merchant payment page, as we are\nusing sandbox to test, let me key-in test account,\nNow we are succeed, now we can go to member center to check our order")]),e._v(" "),n("hr"),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("refer")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("https://www.douban.com/note/221114977/\nhttp://www.businessweekly.com.tw/KBlogArticle.aspx?ID=20&pnumber=1\nhttp://wss.mofcom.gov.cn/article/a/j/201209/20120908345591.shtml\nhttp://www.welinkis.com/html/4127304656.html\nhttp://contest.i21st.cn/article/speaking/4990_1.html\nhttp://www.linewow.com/html/article-34436.html\nhttp://www.businessweekly.com.tw/KBlogArticle.aspx?id=2165")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("接打电话")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("退货 http://chinaenglish.com.cn/html/c11/2012-03/46154.html\nhttps://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Msnhinet8jp/%E6%8B%9C%E7%88%BE%E5%BE%B7\nhttps://sg.ixl.com/promo?partner=google&campaign=1097&adGroup=Visit+%3E8+pages&gclid=CMzGmc-ApMkCFdKIaAodrcYLWw\nhttp://www.mumbrella.asia/2015/09/united-overseas-bank-focuses-on-values-in-right-by-you-brand-refresh-to-mark-80th-year/\nhttp://st.hujiang.com/topic/166448714056/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrbnWZWb92w&index=3&list=PLJ5D4r6yvv5dgaO_LG3G3UpMyTZTg3lhe")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("http://forum.wordreference.com/threads/%E4%BD%A0%E6%9C%80%E6%99%9A%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%E6%97%B6%E5%80%99%E8%A6%81%EF%BC%9F.1299970/")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("http://www.chtoen.com/%E6%A8%A1%E4%BB%BF%E7%9A%84%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%E6%80%8E%E9%BA%BC%E8%AA%AA\nhttp://english.stackexchange.com/questions/64016/ill-take-you-home-ill-bring-you-home\nwalk you home under my umbrella https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=LOVhAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT53&lpg=PT53&dq=walk+you+home+umbrella&source=bl&ots=T-4GUxL4Jz&sig=IHgjf9H3HPsZ6EI8ljEgo8eg5MA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiatJHG6PPPAhXKvLwKHTyuAKMQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=walk%20you%20home%20umbrella&f=false\nhttps://books.google.com.sg/books?id=RYG8BwAAQBAJ&pg=PT48&lpg=PT48&dq=walk+you+home+umbrella&source=bl&ots=ZO9knShWHN&sig=XsXFLy8V5JVU1mCJV8z-n6iINq0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiatJHG6PPPAhXKvLwKHTyuAKMQ6AEIIDAC#v=onepage&q=walk%20you%20home%20umbrella&f=false\nhttp://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:F1-l4ML5KbkJ:www.rr365.com/Article/Class9/200608/7624.html+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk\nhttps://www.douban.com/note/221114977/\nhttp://web2.yzu.edu.tw/YZU/SO/Bilingual%20Campus/Bilingual%20Activities/Bilingual%20Activities_2_3.htm\nhttp://starken.pixnet.net/blog/post/38072249-%E7%94%A8%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%E5%95%8F%E5%A5%BD%E3%80%81%E6%89%93%E6%8B%9B%E5%91%BC%E5%8F%A5%E5%AD%90%E5%A4%A7%E9%9B%86%E5%90%88-\\")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("论洗脑 Brainwash http://edu.sina.com.hk/news/41/1/4/91491/1.html\n冷笑话 lame joke http://www.betamedia.com.tw/blog/post.aspx?ip=329\n用英文問好、打招呼句子大集合\nhttp://starken.pixnet.net/blog/post/38072249-%E7%94%A8%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%E5%95%8F%E5%A5%BD%E3%80%81%E6%89%93%E6%8B%9B%E5%91%BC%E5%8F%A5%E5%AD%90%E5%A4%A7%E9%9B%86%E5%90%88-\nadage proverb http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/73199/what-is-the-difference-between-a-proverb-an-adage-and-an-aphorism\n中英物语 http://www.chtoen.com/\nhttp://edu.qq.com/a/20160401/021015.htm\nWhy do Chinese websites look so busy? https://econsultancy.com/blog/67466-why-do-chinese-websites-look-so-busy")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=a.exports}}]);
