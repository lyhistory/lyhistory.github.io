You have to use a hash function where it's hard to discover the preimage given the hash.A simple example of a hashlock is that Alice chooses a random value X and hashes it to get Y. Alice then creates and a posts a transaction which is locked under two conditions: (1) it needs a signature from Bob, and the second condition is that the input that spends it must also provide an X such that Hash(X) = Y. So if Bob learns the value X, then Bob can spend transaction 1 outputs by using Bob's secret key to generate a signature and also providing the X value. We can use this to make an atomic cross-chain trade. The idea here is that Alice is going to choose a random value X and hashes it to get Y and she is going to post transaction 1. She is not going to tell anyone what X is at this point, she keeps it as a secret. Bob waits for transaction 1 to be confirmed, and then posts transaction 2. At this point, Bob doesn't know what X is. But he knows that if he learns the value X then he can claim money from the outputs of transaction 1. Bob knows this is safe to do becaus ethe only way that Alice can take money out of transaction 2 is by revealing X, and if Bob learns X, then he gains the ability to get money out of transaction 1. So Alice waits for transaction 2 to be confirmed, and then posts transaction 3 which reveals X. This grants Bob the ability to get his money because he now has the preimage. He can get his litecoin now. This is the simplest version of an atomic swap. Alice has swapped litecoin for bitcoin, and Bob has swapped bitcoin for litecoin. They use a hash preimage to make sure that the transaction is atomic.")]),t._v(" "),a("p",[a("strong",[t._v("TierNolan atomic trade protocol")])]),t._v(" "),a("p",[a("strong",[t._v("Time lock")])]),t._v(" "),a("p",[t._v("You want the timelocks to probably do blockheight or blocktime which is the timestamp inside the block.

If Alice's refund happens before Bob's refund then it's no longer safe, and Alice can cheat Bob in that case.
