        <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<h2 id="1-concepts">1. Concepts</h2>

<p>Applying tools and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements
Projects do not exist in isolation but as part of a larger ecosystem that is aimed at delivering benefits to meet the strategic objectives of the business.
Program Management: Manage a group of related projects in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually.
Portfolio Management: Centralized management of a group of projects or programs to facilitate effective management to meet strategic business objectives</p>
<h2 id="2aims">2.Aims</h2>
<p>Project Management KPIs are pegged to the Schedule Scope Cost ( The ‘Triple Constraints’, constraints are boundaries placed on the project)</p>
<h2 id="3dimensions">3.Dimensions</h2>

<p>Project Life Cycle (Concept - development - implementation - close-out)
		Primary purpose of life cycle:  To provide a consistent and effective approach for undertaking projects
		SDLC: A framework for describing the phases involved in developing and maintaining information systems.
Process Groups
		The Project Management Model can be viewed as a number of interlinked process groups:
		Initiating Processes :: To get commitment for the project :: Stakeholder Analysis/Register :: Implementation Strategy, Overall schedule, budget
		Planning Processes :: Establish scope, estimates and schedule and course of action to meet objectives :: Risk assessment, Preparing WBS, Preparing Cost Estimates,Conduct Precedence Analysis, Draw up Schedule :: Duration of activities,Milestones,Responsibilities of team,Project communication protocols, Project Organization Structure
		Executing Processes :: Completing the work done according to plan :: Co-ordinating people and resources, Work deliverables, Performance reports, Updates to project plans and docs :: Trade-offs, Manpower Resource assignments
		Monitoring&amp;Controlling Processes ::Track and regulate the progress and performance :: Change requests(corrective/preventive actions), Analysing deviations,Re-planning, Updates to project docs :: What and when to escalate issues, Project termination, When to close risks, To revise schedule/resources
		Closing Processes :: Finalize all activities to formally close the project/phase :: Final signoff, Complete documentation, Archival of information, Close contracts, Post Implementation Review, Roll-off Personnel, Celebrations :: To accept the system or not What to carry forward into O&amp;S Rewards
		Knowledge Areas
				Interpersonal skills ; General management; The application/business domain; The project environment
				(Project managers must focus on meeting specific project/business objectives by integrating various activities.)</p>
<h2 id="4success-and-failure">4.Success and Failure</h2>
<p>Cause of failure?
Missing focus(Unclear objectives, Lack of business focus); Content issues(Shifting requirements, Technical complexity); Skill issues(Unaligned team, Lack of skills); Execution issues(Unrealistic schedule, Reactive planning)
What must do to ensure project success?
Understand early user needs and get agreement of user requirements;
Gain and retain user and management commitment;
Choose an appropriate SDLC;
Determine whether a formal  Methodology is necessary;
Develop a comprehensive project plan early and Monitor against the plan;
Modify the plan when necessary;
Determine realistic cost estimates;
Equip staff with appropriate skills;
Establish realistic expectations of project amongst all project team;
Accept and manage change;</p>
<h2 id="5pm-certifications">5.PM Certifications</h2>
<p>A Good Project Manager?
Knowledge and Skills(Planning, Observation, Communication)
Behavioral Traits(Ability to operate in uncertainty, Flexible Management Approach)
Motivation(Empathy in combination with Killer Instinct)
Credibility(How respected and trusted is the PM, by superiors, his team, vendors, and clients)</p>

<h1 id="project-initiation">Project Initiation</h1>
<h2 id="1initiation-process-processes-to-define-a-new-project-or-new-phase-of-the-project-by-obtaining-authorization-to-start-the-project-or-phase">1.Initiation Process (Processes to define a new project or new phase of the project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase)</h2>
<p>Create a shared understanding amongst the stakeholders of the purpose and success criteria, improves deliverable acceptance, customer satisfaction and stakeholder satisfaction
Authorises the project
Output: Project Charter, Stakeholder Register
Project Charter - A document endorsed by senior project management that provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities; Content:
<strong>Project Purpose; Objectives/Success criteria;</strong>
The project objectives must address:: Problem/opportunity; Business need; Strategic fit with organizational goals; Inclusions and exclusions to scope;
Products of the project; Successful completion criteria and measurements
<strong>High level requirement;</strong>
Scope issues:: How well defined? How detailed? How important?
<strong>High Level risks;</strong>
All IT projects will contain some element of risk. Project manager’s duty is to minimize and mange risk, In the project initiation stage:
Ensure possible sources of risks are not inserted in the project at this time
Project Managers must recognize these sources of risk
Select a project/technical strategy that will minimize risk
<strong>Summary milestone schedule; Summary budget;</strong>
Budgets and schedules may initially be “fixed” “pre-ordained” or “non-negotiable” But these may be based on:
Inadequate information; Previously made promises; Wishful thinking
As the Project Unfolds, Detail adds costs, Changes add costs
<strong>Stakeholder list;</strong>
Customer enterprise personality type:
Aggressive: organizations are pioneers that consciously and aggressively adopt high-risk strategies to gain potentially high rewards and competitive advantage.
Mainstream: organizations are willing to support moderate risk taking in the adoption of innovation and have the corporate skills and culture to support such initiatives.
Conservative: organizations are cautious adopters of anything new. They are neither willing nor prepared to handle high levels of risk.
<strong>Implementation Approach; Assigned PM;</strong>
<strong>Name and Authority authorizing the Charter</strong></p>
<h2 id="2stakeholder-analysis-identify---analyzeprioritize---engagemange---reviewrefine">2.Stakeholder Analysis (Identify - Analyze&amp;Prioritize - Engage&amp;Mange - Review&amp;Refine)</h2>
<p>individuals and organizations who may be actively involved in the project, and whose interests may be positively or negatively affected as result of project execution or successful project completion.
the project manager, project steering committee, the project sponsor, project owner, user manager, vendor project manager
Output: Stakeholder Register
The register consolidates information about stakeholders from various sources and perspectives. It’s used for the analysis and subsequent formulation of engagement activities to address the needs of the stakeholder.</p>

<h2 id="4work-plan">4.Work Plan</h2>
<p>1) Outlines all relevant aspects of the work including both Process as well as product steps
2) Specifies the project work as a HIERARCHY of work items.The following hierarchy is suggested:
STAGE -&gt; PHASE -&gt; STEP -&gt; ACTIVITY -&gt; TASK
Each phase of the plan should include an activity that covers all aspects of the general project management and administration:
<em>detailed planning of tasks</em>
<em>Internal reporting</em>
<em>Monthly and quarterly progress reporting to the client</em>
<em>Production of meeting minutes</em>
<em>Financial control and reporting</em>
<em>The maintenance of the project filing system</em>
Each phase of the work plan should include a Quality Assurance activity. This activity covers the following tasks:
<em>The PRODUCTION of the QUALITY PLAN which will state the methods, procedures and quality responsibilities used by the project</em>
<em>The QUALITY AUDIT of the project, against the QA plan produced in the Initial Planning Phase, by the project QA manager</em>
<em>The MODIFICATION of the QA plan, if necessary, and its approval by the QA manager</em>
<em>The production of LOCAL(project specific) PROCEDURES and their approval by the QA manager</em>
<em>The provision of ADVICE  to the project on QUALITY MATTERS by the QA manager</em>

<p>The Project Quality Assurance Plan</p>

<p><strong>Project 2013</strong>
Microsoft Project will also allow you to level resource for the project and will also allow you to resolve resource conflicts. For example, if you wish to analyze the resource allocations of the various member of the project team then:</p>

<p>1.Look at the Resource Sheet View(Select <view>, then <Resource Sheet=""> from the top level menu)</Resource></view></p>

<p>2.You can also use the Resource Usage view to search for all over-allocated resources. In the resource usage view, over-allocated resources will appear in red on the left panel. Click the bottom scroll bar of the right panel to view when the resource is over-allocated and why</p>

<p>3.Go back to the Gantt chart view and change the timescales to below:</p>

<p>4.We can remove the overload through resource leveling. Firstly, save a copy of the plan. Manually carry out the resource leveling for the Project lead. How would you reallocate his time? What is the impact to the overall project?</p>

<p>5.Use your original plan and go to the Gantt chart view. Activate the auto-levelling. Select the resource tab on the top-level menu. Then select<Level-all>. This levels all the resources. How has the project been impacted? What are the pros and cons of using the auto-levelling feature in MS Project?</Level-all></p>

<p>https://www.liquidplanner.com/blog/project-management-shortcuts-resource-leveling-made-easy/</p>

<p>http://www.projectinsight.net/blogs/project-management-software-implementation-and-user-adoption-tips/resource-leveling-can-you-or-should-you-level</p>

<p>6.This will re-schedule the activities in the project to ensure that project leader resource over-allocation alone does not take place, i.e., no more than 100% of the Project Leader is assigned at any one time. The Resource Graph will change to reflect the new allocation and the starting and ending dates of the activities would be impacted as well.</p>

<p>7.To review the results apply the Leveling Gantt View.(The top bar represents where a task was before it was leveled, the bottom bar represents where it is now). Pay attention to the Leveling Delay field to see by how many days a task has been delayed.</p>

<p>8.If you would like to repeat the leveling exercise, select Resource Tab,<Clear leveling=""> This will restore the resource allocation to the original state before leveling. Once again, pay close attention to the tasks that caused over-loading, what are their original starting and ending dates and what are their new starting and ending dates after leveling.</Clear></p>
