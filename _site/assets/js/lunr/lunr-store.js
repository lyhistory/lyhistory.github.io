Markdown Lanuage:  https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ To add new posts, simply add a file in the _posts directory that follows the convention YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext and includes the necessary front matter.   2. Work with Jekyll:   1) Commands to use:  ruby --version gem install bundler bundle install --force bundle info \"github-pages\" bundle info \"jekyll-remote-theme\" bundle exec jekyll serve To update:: If you followed our setup recommendations and installed Bundler, run bundle update github-pages or simply bundle update and all your gems will update to the latest versions. If you don't have Bundler installed, run gem update github-pages   2) Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:   def print_hi(name)   puts \"Hi, #{name}\" end print_hi('Tom') #=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.  3. Troubleshooting           Your site is having problems building: You have an error on line 16 of your _config.yml file https://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator       Conversion error: Jekyll::Converters::Scss encountered an error while converting ‘assets/css/main.scss’: Invalid GBK character “\\xE2” on line 54 windows users may got this issue,  open powershell, execute     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned New-Item -Path $Profile -ItemType file -Force          C:\\Users&lt;yourname&gt;\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 copy paste “chcp 65001 &gt;$null”(without quote) inito it and save, then open up another powershell should do the trick refer to https://williamwang.info/setup-jekyll-on-windows/       failed load  jekyll-xxxx plugin try install it in your Gemfile and add it to the plugins array of _config.yml   4.

General workflow will be: user log on website.com through oauth.com, on oauth successfully website.com pass access_token to chatroom.com, then last step, chatroom use access_token to retrieve user info from API.com, this process is also considered as logon chatroom.   My colleague suggests me to use signalr, compare to super socket, it’s much more easy to draw UI because UI for such an online chatting room is very complicated, another advantage of signalr is that it supports long-polling, means those browsers not supporting websocket will also works fine, while the disadvantage is I need to maintain my own ‘sessions’, signalr or most web sockets do not support session feature by default.( why? answer in my blog ‘About Session’ )  2.Business Modeling  Domain Modeling ( use case driven approach,the task of discovering ‘objects’ that represent those business entities and concepts)   User(name,online status)   Friends   Conversation Room – chat group (name, creator,members,status)   Message – Private Message, Group Message   Recently chat list  3.Requirements  when user successfully connected with server,If he doesn’t have nickname yet, required to update user info through api.com.   after checking nickname, he will be auto assigned to one of the lobbies(system setting channels);   user can switch channels, can check users online status and add friends,   start private conversation with friends,   create chat group with selected friends,manage chat group, invite friend, kick out member.   system will keep track of users’ recently chat records,   missed messages will push to user as soon as he get online.  4.Analysis &amp; Design  4.1 Tech  MVC for presentation layer   SignalR for communication layer   Mongodb for db layer  4.2 Detail  user persistence: session   security: form authentication   CookieAuthenticationSample Using ajaxSetup beforeSend for Basic Auth is breaking SignalR connection   Understanding and Handling Connection Lifetime Events in SignalR   Emoticons （Verify Code e4d6） 聊天表情源码 提取码 e4d6   5.implement  Logic:  signalr reconnect?   rejoin room ? missed message push?   session lost handling? token expired handling?   fallback handling,go back to client side, ask for new token ?   performance enhancement?   code refactor?

Let’s meet the murderer !!!   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17659603/async-void-asp-net-and-count-of-outstanding-operations Regarding “fire and forget”: I personally never use this phrase for async void methods. For one thing, the error handling semantics most certainly do not fit in with the phrase “fire and forget”; I half-jokingly refer to async void methods as “fire and crash”. A true async “fire and forget” method would be an async Task method where you ignore the returned Task rather than waiting for it. That said, in ASP.NET you almost never want to return early from requests (which is what “fire and forget” implies). This answer is already too long, but I have a description of the problems on my blog, along with some code to support ASP.NET “fire and forget” if it’s truly necessary.   http://www.wiliam.com.au/wiliam-blog/async-void-dont-use-it https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj991977.aspx   3.query in MongoDB using C# Driver  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24169849/searching-an-array-of-objects-in-mongodb-using-the-c-sharp-driver   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5457637/mongodb-field-array-searching-c-how-to?rq=1   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25727553/querying-an-array-of-arrays-with-the-mongodb-c-sharp-driver?rq=1   4.httpcontext session/cookie is null with IE  You can try the following code by adding in Global.asax file   protected void Application_BeginRequest(object sender, EventArgs e) { HttpContext.Current.Response.AddHeader(“p3p”, “CP=\"CAO PSA OUR\"”); } The problem lies with a W3C standard called Platform for Privacy Preferences or P3P. This will allow Internet Explorer to accept your cookie.

Method (M): The name of the Handler that will process the message.     Groups: Clients can be grouped on the servers in “groups” for pub-sub implementation.     Arguments (A): The actual content to be passed to the hander on the client or on the server.     Cursor (C): Represents a position in the message stream.     Index (I): The Id of the handler or Callback. Hub Message Format       Hub Request format (“send” request)     Data={“I”:index,”H”:”samplingstreaminghub”,”M”:”ConnectToStream”,”A”:[“StreamUri”]}     Hubs messages format (server to client)                 {“C”:”messageId value”, “M”:[{“H”:”HubName”,”M”:”HandlerName”,”A”: [“argument list as json”]}]}                  {“C”:”messageId value”, “G”: [“groupName”],”g”: [“groupName”],”T”:1, “M”:[{“H”:”HubName”,”M”:”HandlerName”,”A”: [“argument list as json”]}]}             Hub Payloads format (“send” request or inside “M” element of Hub message)          {“H”:”HubName”,”M”:”HandlerName”,”A”: [argument list as json],                                    “S”:{state as json},”I”:index}     {“H”:”HubName”,”M”:”HandlerName”,”A”: [argument list as json],”I”:index} Hub Response examples (“send” response)     {“I”:”0”,”R”:{“return object as json}}     {“I”: 0} -&gt; no result     {“I”: 0, “S”:{“x”:1},”R”:1} –&gt; result     {“I”: 0, “E”:”This is an error”} –&gt; error     {“I”: 0, “E”:”This is an error”, “T”: “Some stack trace here”} -&gt; error + stack The following is a complete list of the messages elements: Hub Messages:       C – Cursor M – Messages T – Timeout (only if true) value is 1 D – Disconnect (only if true) value is 1 R – All Groups (Client groups should be reset to match this list exactly) G – Groups added g – Groups removed     Hub payload:     I – Callback Operation index H – Hub name M – method name A – arguments S – state (if not null)     Hub Method return value:     I – Operation index R – Result S – State E – Error T – stack trace D – Error Data     The cursor mechanism As described above the message contains a cursor for identifying the location in the stream. A cursor represents where a particular client is in an infinite stream of messages. If the client disconnects and then reconnects, it asks the OI streaming API for any messages that arrived after the client’s cursor value. The same thing happens when a connection uses long polling. After a long poll request completes, the client opens a new connection and asks for messages that arrived after the cursor.     To find more information download the signalR source code from github. To find the message format just search for json serialization attributes (by searching for “M” for example).    reference:   MongoDB:   High Performance Search using MongoDB and ASP.NET MVC   Authentication: Storing Custom Data in Forms Authentication Tickets form authentication timeout not working Authentication with SignalR and OAuth Bearer Token Set Context User Principal for Customized Authentication in SignalR   Session: Real-time User Notification and Session Management with SignalR   UI: jQuery plugin to style emoticons with pure CSS3 properties (no images) Open sourcing Twitter emoji for everyone jquery.qqFace.js 纯JS+MVC 打造Web实时聊天室   relevant question: How to do forms authentication with SignalR (separate domains)?

Asynchronous operations may only be started within an asynchronous handler or module or during certain events in the Page lifecycle. If this exception occurred while executing a Page, ensure that the Page is marked &lt;%@ Page Async=”true” %&gt;.   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13647346/calling-async-method-in-controller   Error: DeadLocks    Don’t Block on Async Code: from http://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/07/dont-block-on-async-code.html  // My \"library\" method. public static async Task&lt;JObject&gt; GetJsonAsync(Uri uri) { using (var client = new HttpClient()) { var jsonString = await client.GetStringAsync(uri); return JObject.Parse(jsonString); } } // My \"top-level\" method. public void Button1_Click(...) { var jsonTask = GetJsonAsync(...); textBox1.Text = jsonTask.Result; }  The top-level method calls GetJsonAsync (within the UI/ASP.NET context). GetJsonAsync starts the REST request by calling HttpClient.GetStringAsync (still within the context). GetStringAsync returns an uncompleted Task, indicating the REST request is not complete. GetJsonAsync awaits the Task returned by GetStringAsync. The context is captured and will be used to continue running the GetJsonAsync method later. GetJsonAsync returns an uncompleted Task, indicating that the GetJsonAsync method is not complete. The top-level method synchronously blocks on the Task returned by GetJsonAsync. This blocks the context thread. … Eventually, the REST request will complete. This completes the Task that was returned by GetStringAsync. The continuation for GetJsonAsync is now ready to run, and it waits for the context to be available so it can execute in the context. Deadlock. The top-level method is blocking the context thread, waiting for GetJsonAsync to complete, and GetJsonAsync is waiting for the context to be free so it can complete.   Preventing the Deadlock   There are two best practices (both covered in my intro post) that avoid this situation:   In your “library” async methods, use ConfigureAwait(false) wherever possible. Don’t block on Tasks; use async all the way down.   Consider the first best practice. The new “library” method looks like this:  public static async Task&lt;JObject&gt; GetJsonAsync(Uri uri) { using (var client = new HttpClient()) { var jsonString = await client.GetStringAsync(uri).ConfigureAwait(false); return JObject.Parse(jsonString); } }  This changes the continuation behavior of GetJsonAsync so that it does not resume on the context. Instead, GetJsonAsync will resume on a thread pool thread. This enables GetJsonAsync to complete the Task it returned without having to re-enter the context.   Consider the second best practice. The new “top-level” methods look like this:  public async void Button1_Click(...) { var json = await GetJsonAsync(...); textBox1.Text = json; }  public class MyController : ApiController { public async Task&lt;string&gt; Get() { var json = await GetJsonAsync(...); return json.ToString(); } }  This changes the blocking behavior of the top-level methods so that the context is never actually blocked; all “waits” are “asynchronous waits”.   Note: It is best to apply both best practices. Either one will prevent the deadlock, but both must be applied to achieve maximum performance and responsiveness.     Calling async method synchronously  void Func(){  Task&lt;string&gt; sCode = Task.Run(async () =&gt; { string msg =await GenerateCodeAsync(); return msg; });  }  3.Threading.Timer run Async Task  Sometimes you may encounter such a requirement that you have a timer, and you have to do a async operation inside timer’s callback which is a sync method.

Acknowledgement of such an ultimate terminus of trinity provides a focus; having a focus enables calmness; a calm demeanour brings about tranquility; a tranquil mind allows for clear deliberation; clear deliberation leads to attainment of wisdom. There exist the fundamental and incidental, everything has a beginning and an end, knowing what comes first and after takes one closer to knowing the way.    Those of the ancient times who wished to extend the way to the whole world must first have their states governed well; in order to govern a state well, they would have to have their family clans rationally managed; to be able to rationally manage family clans would require of them personal probity; to ensure personal probity, one must maintain a just mind; a just mind should hold only sincere intentions; upholding of sincere intentions would require one to attain and accumulate wisdom; wisdom is attained and accumulated by exploring and analysing aspects and perspectives of facts and knowledge. Thoroughly explored and analysed facts and knowledge give rise to wisdom; wisdom ensures intentions are sincere; upholding of sincere intentions frames a just mind; once a mind is just, personal probity ensues; personal probity directs rational management of family clans; the ability to manage family clans rationally can then be further developed to facilitate proper state governance; well-governed states ultimately lead to world peace.   From emperors to the common people, all must concentrate on ensuring personal probity as the basis of all else. Having a disorderly basis yet expecting to govern all is impossible to achieve. Thinning on substance to grow abundant based on the measly is never attainable.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"1.Web  Websites are open, no need to install, and the websites are easy to deploy and update compared to native app, no need wait for app store approval and updating always on server side.   HTML5 is growing more robust and feature-rich, now with html5 device API, we are able to get access and control hardware like sensors/camera/battery. It enables web app to do most of the things that a native app can do.   Web applications are relatively easy to move to other platforms, although there will be some compatibility issues for different devices, but it’s much easier than translating a native app from swift to java   Web applications have gotten a bad reputation – sometimes slow, and websites always rely on network connectivity, and for game players, experience using mobile web may not as smooth as native apps.   HTML5 compatibility on mobile and tablet browsers with testing on real devices   Framework: HTML5 powered framework like JQuery mobile/Sencha, etc   Bootstrap –HTML/CSS/JS toolkit, mobile first front end framework for responsible layout;   jquery mobile   it gives a lot of mobile-oriented features like swipe-events, page transitions, allows for single/multipage applications, AJAX page preload, and history manipulation API, and lots of touch-friendly components/widgets, because everything is done through HTML5 markup, jQuery Mobile application still needs to process that markup in the background during the application real-time execution, and JavaScript is a workhorse, in that case. This combined with mobile browsers will result in below-average performances   http://mobilehtml5.org/   sample: http://www.girliemac.com/presentation-slides/html5-mobile-approach/deviceAPIs.html   https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/Mobile   2.Native  1.andoird   JIT JVM machine code, android runtime on linux os   https://www.quora.com/Why-is-ART-better-than-Dalvik   just-in-time compile java code to byte code or machine instruction code, which will later running on vm.   http://www.zdnet.com/article/how-android-works-the-big-picture/   2.ios  3.Hybrid:  Basically there are two types of hybrid frameworks:   Frameworks like phonegap/cordova use web view, wraps application in a browser with no url bar, developer then builds the application as a web site, but it is packaged and looks like a native app on the device with limited native API access, because mobile browser is sandboxed from native APIs to ensure battery performance and device security.   Another type of hybrid frameworks claims they are ‘truly native’ frameworks: react native/native script/xmaria, these frameworks are the huge improvements from the Phonegap/Cordova   1.webview  Phonegap client communicates with an application server to receive data using standard web protocols. Phonegap acts as a client for the user to interact with, the application server is normally a web server which performs business logic and calculations, and generally retrieves or persists data from a separate data repository.  2.truly native  Xamarin   is a runtime for building cross-platform mobile applications using c# and the .NET framework, the .NET framework is not supported on either IOS or Android, Xamarin provides a close approximation of the .NET framework for these platforms via an open source port of .NET called Mono.   native script:    https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript#installation   https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/04/my-experience-developing-with-telerik-nativescript/   NativeScript simply executes JavaScript on the underlying native operating system.     NativeScript is following the classic approach like Android. Running JavaScript on the UI thread allows NativeScript to deliver on one of its core guiding principles: provide high-performance access to 100% of native platform APIs through JavaScript. Period. No trade-offs. No limits.   java script packaged by native script CLI(npm) to Java code/object-c, and finally compiled to byte code https://www.nativescript.org/blog/nativescript-and-xamarin Build Process   Both NativeScript and Xamarin support building Android applications on Windows. They also both support building directly to iOS on a Mac. Due to the fact that Apple has restricted the building of iOS applications to a macOS machine, neither NativeScript nor Xamarin can build iOS apps directly on Windows. However, there are solutions provided by both frameworks for this issue.   While iOS apps can be coded with Xamarin on a Windows machine, Xamarin requires ssh access to a macOS machine in order to do the actual build for iOS. There is no way around this. With Xamarin, the developer must have access to a Mac to build iOS binaries.   In the case of NativeScript, the AppBuilder extension from Telerik provides a cloud build service that does not require the developer to own a Mac. This is essentially a networked Mac that we own and provide to developers as a service. The developer then builds on the Windows machine, the code is compiled on our servers and sent back to you in IPA format, ready to be installed on iOS.   NativeScript also provides companion applications that can be downloaded from the iOS and Android app stores. These companion apps allow developers to load their applications on their devices without actually installing them. This is very helpful during the development process.   Mobile web views are slow, and worse, they behave differently on different platforms and platform versions.  It is difficult to get consistency when using them and results in inconsistent experiences for the users of your applications.   NativeScript instead maps the XML layouts and styles at build time to their native counterparts leaving you with a 100% native mobile application.  There are not inconsistencies in performance when it comes to native layouts and code.  Sure there may be differences in appearance, but that is normal between platform versions.   React Native   is using the Virtual DOM for updating the UI like React. React Native will calculate the changes in the background thread and keep the UI thread untouched if there is no change. So, UI will be very responsive. But, If the component makes a lot of calls to the native OS, then the app will be slow.   https://www.infoq.com/articles/react-native-introduction ##################################################   web vs native:   http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/nativedebate/   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/95635/what-does-a-just-in-time-jit-compiler-do   A JIT compiler runs after the program has started and compiles the code (usually bytecode or some kind of VM instructions) on the fly (or just-in-time, as it’s called) into a form that’s usually faster, typically the host CPU’s native instruction set. A JIT has access to dynamic runtime information whereas a standard compiler doesn’t and can make better optimizations like inlining functions that are used frequently.   This is in contrast to a traditional compiler that compiles all the code to machine language before the program is first run.   To paraphrase, conventional compilers build the whole program as an EXE file BEFORE the first time you run it. For newer style programs, an assembly is generated with pseudocode (p-code). Only AFTER you execute the program on the OS (e.g., by double-clicking on its icon) will the (JIT) compiler kick in and generate machine code (m-code) that the Intel-based processor or whatever will understand.   http://www.infoworld.com/article/2621943/mobile-development/13-essential-programming-tools-for-the-mobile-web.html  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"SDLC   ISS-IDEF0 diagrams   Object Oriented Modeling   Domain Modeling &amp; Design Modeling   A domain model is called conceptual model in database modeling, while a design model is called logical model.   These distinctions are also used in model-driven development, where we have a succession of three types of models:   (solution-independent) domain models resulting from domain/requirements engineering in the system analysis, or inception, phase of a development project (platform-independent) design models resulting from the system design activities in the elaboration phase (platform-specific) implementation models, which are derived from a design model   While system modeling includes both information and process modeling, you seem to be concerned with information modeling only. Here, we can use the terms “domain class diagram” and “design class diagram” for the conceptual information model and the information design model made in the form of UML class diagrams.

Concepts   Applying tools and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements Projects do not exist in isolation but as part of a larger ecosystem that is aimed at delivering benefits to meet the strategic objectives of the business. Program Management: Manage a group of related projects in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually. Portfolio Management: Centralized management of a group of projects or programs to facilitate effective management to meet strategic business objectives  2.Aims  Project Management KPIs are pegged to the Schedule Scope Cost ( The ‘Triple Constraints’, constraints are boundaries placed on the project)  3.Dimensions   Project Life Cycle (Concept - development - implementation - close-out) \t\tPrimary purpose of life cycle:  To provide a consistent and effective approach for undertaking projects \t\tSDLC: A framework for describing the phases involved in developing and maintaining information systems. Process Groups \t\tThe Project Management Model can be viewed as a number of interlinked process groups: \t\tInitiating Processes :: To get commitment for the project :: Stakeholder Analysis/Register :: Implementation Strategy, Overall schedule, budget \t\tPlanning Processes :: Establish scope, estimates and schedule and course of action to meet objectives :: Risk assessment, Preparing WBS, Preparing Cost Estimates,Conduct Precedence Analysis, Draw up Schedule :: Duration of activities,Milestones,Responsibilities of team,Project communication protocols, Project Organization Structure \t\tExecuting Processes :: Completing the work done according to plan :: Co-ordinating people and resources, Work deliverables, Performance reports, Updates to project plans and docs :: Trade-offs, Manpower Resource assignments \t\tMonitoring&amp;Controlling Processes ::Track and regulate the progress and performance :: Change requests(corrective/preventive actions), Analysing deviations,Re-planning, Updates to project docs :: What and when to escalate issues, Project termination, When to close risks, To revise schedule/resources \t\tClosing Processes :: Finalize all activities to formally close the project/phase :: Final signoff, Complete documentation, Archival of information, Close contracts, Post Implementation Review, Roll-off Personnel, Celebrations :: To accept the system or not What to carry forward into O&amp;S Rewards \t\tKnowledge Areas \t\t\t\tInterpersonal skills ; General management; The application/business domain; The project environment \t\t\t\t(Project managers must focus on meeting specific project/business objectives by integrating various activities.)  4.Success and Failure  Cause of failure?

How detailed? How important? High Level risks; All IT projects will contain some element of risk. Project manager’s duty is to minimize and mange risk, In the project initiation stage: Ensure possible sources of risks are not inserted in the project at this time Project Managers must recognize these sources of risk Select a project/technical strategy that will minimize risk Summary milestone schedule; Summary budget; Budgets and schedules may initially be “fixed” “pre-ordained” or “non-negotiable” But these may be based on: Inadequate information; Previously made promises; Wishful thinking As the Project Unfolds, Detail adds costs, Changes add costs Stakeholder list; Customer enterprise personality type: Aggressive: organizations are pioneers that consciously and aggressively adopt high-risk strategies to gain potentially high rewards and competitive advantage. Mainstream: organizations are willing to support moderate risk taking in the adoption of innovation and have the corporate skills and culture to support such initiatives. Conservative: organizations are cautious adopters of anything new. They are neither willing nor prepared to handle high levels of risk.

PHASE -&gt; STEP -&gt; ACTIVITY -&gt; TASK Each phase of the plan should include an activity that covers all aspects of the general project management and administration: detailed planning of tasks Internal reporting Monthly and quarterly progress reporting to the client Production of meeting minutes Financial control and reporting The maintenance of the project filing system Each phase of the work plan should include a Quality Assurance activity. This activity covers the following tasks: The PRODUCTION of the QUALITY PLAN which will state the methods, procedures and quality responsibilities used by the project The QUALITY AUDIT of the project, against the QA plan produced in the Initial Planning Phase, by the project QA manager The MODIFICATION of the QA plan, if necessary, and its approval by the QA manager The production of LOCAL(project specific) PROCEDURES and their approval by the QA manager The provision of ADVICE  to the project on QUALITY MATTERS by the QA manager 3) Forms a BASIS for estimating STAFF EFFORT requirements 4) Forms a BASIS for determining the TIME SCHEDULE  5.Staff Effort Requirements  Estimating Staff Effort Project Roles Staff Type Staff Effort  6.Timescales and Milestones  7.Project Budgets  8.Project Deliverables  9.Project Structure and Staffing  10.Supporting Resources  11.Sample Project Plan Standards  12.Project Plan Assignment   The Project Quality Assurance Plan   Project 2013 Microsoft Project will also allow you to level resource for the project and will also allow you to resolve resource conflicts. For example, if you wish to analyze the resource allocations of the various member of the project team then:   1.Look at the Resource Sheet View(Select , then  from the top level menu)   2.You can also use the Resource Usage view to search for all over-allocated resources. In the resource usage view, over-allocated resources will appear in red on the left panel. Click the bottom scroll bar of the right panel to view when the resource is over-allocated and why   3.Go back to the Gantt chart view and change the timescales to below:   4.We can remove the overload through resource leveling. Firstly, save a copy of the plan. Manually carry out the resource leveling for the Project lead. How would you reallocate his time? What is the impact to the overall project?   5.Use your original plan and go to the Gantt chart view. Activate the auto-levelling. Select the resource tab on the top-level menu. Then select. This levels all the resources. How has the project been impacted? What are the pros and cons of using the auto-levelling feature in MS Project?   https://www.liquidplanner.com/blog/project-management-shortcuts-resource-leveling-made-easy/   http://www.projectinsight.net/blogs/project-management-software-implementation-and-user-adoption-tips/resource-leveling-can-you-or-should-you-level   6.This will re-schedule the activities in the project to ensure that project leader resource over-allocation alone does not take place, i.e., no more than 100% of the Project Leader is assigned at any one time. The Resource Graph will change to reflect the new allocation and the starting and ending dates of the activities would be impacted as well.   7.To review the results apply the Leveling Gantt View.(The top bar represents where a task was before it was leveled, the bottom bar represents where it is now). Pay attention to the Leveling Delay field to see by how many days a task has been delayed.   8.If you would like to repeat the leveling exercise, select Resource Tab, This will restore the resource allocation to the original state before leveling. Once again, pay close attention to the tasks that caused over-loading, what are their original starting and ending dates and what are their new starting and ending dates after leveling.

        "title": "REPL VS SHELL",
        "excerpt":"sample: spark shell, scala repl, python shell   Read–eval–print loop https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop   Difference between a REPL and interactive shell https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/168285/difference-between-a-repl-and-interactive-shell   REPL: This is a procedure that just loops, accepts one command at a time, executing it, and printing the result.   The three steps at each iteration of the loop are:   Calling read to read the characters that make up a textual expression from the keyboard input buffer, and construct a data structure to represent it, Calling eval to evaluate the expression–intuitively, eval “figures out what the expression means,” and “does what it says to do,” returning the value of the expression–and Calling write to print a textual representation of the resulting from eval, so that the user can see it. You can write your own read-eval-print loop for your own programs, so that users can type in expressions, and you can interpret them any way you want. You can start up your read-eval-print loop (by typing in (rep-loop)), and it will take over from the normal Scheme read-eval-print loop, interpreting expressions your way.   Here’s a very simple read-eval-print loop:  (define (rep-loop) (display \"repl&gt;\") ; print a prompt (write (eval (read))) ; read expr., pass to eval, write result (rep-loop)) ; loop (tail-recursive call) to do it again   Notice that the expression (write (eval (read))) does things in the proper read-eval-print order, because the argument to each procedure call is computed before the actual call.   Interactive Shell : An interactive shell reads commands from user input on a terminal. Among other things, such a shell reads startup files on activation, displays a prompt, and enables job control by default. The user can interact with the shell.That’s how the interactive shell name came into being . Let us consider this bash script :  #!/bin/bash echo -n \"Enter the value of variable 'var1': \" read var1 echo \"var1 = $var1\" echo  echo -n \"Enter the values of variables 'var2' and 'var3' \" echo =n \"(separated by a space or tab): \" read var2 var3 echo \"var2 = $var2 var3 = $var3\" # If you input only one value, #+ the other variable(s) will remain unset (null).  exit 0   Now the script above interacts with the user, it asks the user to enter inputs based on which it does its calculations. That’s why it behaves like an interactive shell.   Similary, the python interpreter which most people use to learn python is an interactive one as it communicates with its user.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"In my previous experience with ASP.NET session handling, I have lots of misunderstanding, list below:   1.Session has nothing to do with User!  It always come to me like that session only be set after use log on,  we have heart beat to keep it ‘alive’, this impression made me misunderstand session for a very long time, session has nothing to do with user status, as long as you access httpcontext.Session[“XXX”], session will be created, of course if you have not set any value to it, session will be null , but you still got a ASP.NET_SessionId, however this value will ever change when page reload until you set some value to session(strategy by asp.net, for performance issues).Actually some website, online shopping sites for example allow user using shopping cart before their login, they do store shopping data in session.   2.Http transport VS WebSocket Transport, which one need session?  why http transport need session, because it’s stateless, after one round request &amp; response, disconnect, server need to know which client he communicates all the time, but for web socket, as it’s long connection, duplex messaging, server already know the client very well after handshaking, no need session id anymore, so most web socket framework like signalr is session-less.   3.Mixed Session with Authentication(Form Authentication etc.)  In Practice, people always mixed these two, and get confused, produced many bugs hard to trace, there are some reason:   a.by default they all use cookie, ASP.NET_SessionId &amp; ASPXAUTH (actually session can be cookie-less, you can dig it yourself) b.they all have timeout setting, in process session default timeout is 20mins, while FormAuthentication is 2880mins c.we are used to handling users data with session and FormAuthentication,when session timeout but authentication still not, bugs come out.   though they are very similar,but from previous two points you can see session has nothing to do with user, people like me who have weak foundation on asp.net( I jumped in asp.net mvc3 development without any web dev experience ), please refer to the link about ‘ASP.NET Session and Forms Authentication’  attached at the end of this post , from some respect, you can use customized cache instead of session,session is only about store client info(no need to be a login user) , but FormAuthentication is used to handler user status,the tickets, used for role management, user permission checking.

And for blockchain developers it’s even more crucial to setup multiple virtual instances to interact with each other, someone may debate that, most of the time you can simply run a single node: for bitcoin core you have regtest mode, for ETH you have ganache and truffle dev, for EOS you have docker composer, yet for a comprehensive project, there are much more bulding blocks beside the running nodes, normally you’ll have a large portion of off-chain components like database, web api etc, and for consortium blockchain like hyperledger, you have to run multi nodes: peer nodes, orderer nodes.   It’s always good for us to level up a little bit our knowledge on virtualbox.   For demonstration my hosting machine is windows, virtualbox version 6.0,  one common requirement is that we need database and backend service running on internal network or intranet,  blockchain nodes and websites talking to both intranet and external internet. based on the abilities comparision of different virtualbox network mode:                  Mode       VM-&gt;Host       VM&lt;-Host       VM1&lt;-&gt;VM2       VM-&gt;Net/LAN       VM&lt;-Net/LAN                       Host-only       +       +       +       -       -                 Internal       -       -       +       -       -                 Bridged       +       +       +       +       +                 NAT       +       PortForward       -       +       PortForward                 NATservice       +       PortForward       +       +       PortForward              Host-only networking is particularly useful for preconfigured virtual appliances, where multiple virtual machines are shipped together and designed to cooperate. For example, one virtual machine may contain a web server and a second one a database, and since they are intended to talk to each other, the appliance can instruct Oracle VM VirtualBox to set up a host-only network for the two. A second, bridged, network would then connect the web server to the outside world to serve data to, but the outside world cannot connect to the database.    To achieve the requirement, we choose the following configuration for our virtualbox instance setup:      vb1 to host database and backend service: host-only mode   vb2 to host blockchain nodes and websites: bridged mode and host-only mode   , so the expected result would be:   host machine can talk to both vb1 and vb2 through ssh(default port 22, highly recommend winscp for windows users), vb1 can only talk to vb2 and host machine vb2 can talk to everything   1.Setup host network manager for host-only network config                   vb1                               vb2                 somehow dhcp not working sometimes for the bridged adapter, if you find that dhcp doesn’t allocate ip for your bridged interface, you can manually fix it: dhclient eth0 or you can edit network interface config to make it static  vim /etc/network/interfaces auto lo iface lo inet loopback  auto eth0 iface eth0 inet static \taddress yourip \tnetmask 255.255.255.0 \tgateway your gateway      2.Commands   ifconfig ip route show route -n cat /etc/network/interfaces /etc/init.d/networking restart service network-manager restart  ifdown eth0 ifup eth0 dhclient eth0 Ifconfig eth0 [ip] netmask 255.255.255.0 up route add default gw [gateway] eth0 ip route add default via [gateway] dev eth0   3.Further learning   1) you can even config vb2 as a router by changing gateway of vb1, so you can do some data traffic monitoring easily   2) sometimes you may find your disk space used up, very common when you pull lots of dockers images or your blockchain nodes sync gigbytes of chain data, if you don’t want to start over the setup again, good news is that you can always resize your vdi:           resize before install os: VBoxVBoxManage.exe modifyhd your.vdi --resize [targetsize]            resize after install os: use gparted, detail refer to http://derekmolloy.ie/resize-a-virtualbox-disk/       refer: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html  ","categories": [],

        "title": "Tutorial:Blockchain:How to add BTC payment method",
        "excerpt":"Recently I’ve been asked to provide a demo of BTC top up and withdraw services to integrate with our website. As a Chinese saying goes that lay a brick to attract a jade, the purpose I wrote down my thoughts and some notes is only hoping more people would join the discussion and correct me.   Objectives: basically our website provides membership service for users to top up and enjoy attracted discounts and bonus awards, to cater for arising demands that more and more users prefer BTC than fiat currencies, we decide to introduce one more payment channel with requirements described as follows:   1.1 Functionalities  1&gt; Allow users to top up with BTC, so users can transfer in BTC and convert into platform supported fiat balance. 2&gt; Allow users to withdraw their remained balance and receive converted BTC amount with their own BTC address   1.2 Concerns  1&gt; How to generate and assign BTC address to each user safely without exposing private key Can be solved by BIP32 Hierarchical deterministic key creation, basically we can generate child BTC address from XPUB(parent extension public key), so the web site that communicates to the insecure external network just need to know “parent extension public key”. [Refer to https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki: Deterministic wallets do not require such frequent backups, and elliptic curve mathematics permit schemes where one can calculate the public keys without revealing the private keys.]   2&gt; How to maintain so many BTC addresses that assigned to users in an efficient manner By adopting BIP44 protocol, we can maintain BTC address in a structured and compatible format, for example, according to BIP44, we can design two main accounts for example: External account(for users): m/44’/0’/0’/0/address_index Internal account(for internal use): m/44’/0’/1’/0/address_index we can derive fresh BTC key info with parent key and increment address index, And by linking BTC address info(address, index, creationdate) with userid in the DB table, later on, we can even implement address recycle logic: simply cross check user top up history and BTC address creation date to recycle for example those that haven’t been used for 3 months.   3&gt; How to manage those “small balance”(accurately should be utxo) received by thousands of BTC addresses that we have assigned to users Aggregate and transfer the “small balance” into internal wallet   4&gt; How do we handle user withdraw requests, should we simply transfer from ‘central wallet’ To be honest, I cannot think of more reasonable design than a central wallet, so in my design, central wallet serve as “settlement reserve funds”, we can use internal account mentioned above in 2&gt; m/44’/0’/1’/0/address_index , to keep it simple we can just use one fixed account m/44’/0’/1’/0/0, and we should also keep monitoring the balance of the internal account to ensure sufficient funds available for withdraw requests.   5&gt; How to set up a so-called cold and hot wallet, and where should we place them in our design From the above discussion we already have a rough idea that there should be different levels of security requirements: i) security level for external accounts that assigned to users are low, for individual users, the amount they top up supposed to be relatively small amount of money, and we need to aggregate those small amount into a central account regularly, therefore external accounts are definitely hot wallet ii) security level for internal accounts are high, because internal accounts hold a large amount of money, but can we really make it 100% cold storage? I don’t think so, because it still needs to transfer out BTC regularly corresponding to users withdraw requests, you may say that we can create raw transaction and sign it offline, but still you need to know the withdraw requests first(connect to DB), and you need to know unspent transactions of this account in order to compose raw transaction(connect to BTC node), thus it can not be a physically disconnected cold wallet,but we can increase secure level by keeping it in secure intranet, let’s call it semi-cold wallet iii) as long as BTC is not stored on a physically isolated machine, it’s not 100% safe, we shouldn’t put all the eggs in one basket, so what we can do is put some percentage of the BTC into cold wallet, let’s say 60% in cold wallet, 40% in semi-cold wallet to handle withdraw.   1.3 Workflow  1&gt; Top-up Flow i) The user selects BTC payment method and key in 15000 CNY, the website app automatically displays 0.5 BTC based on the current exchange rate, the user confirms and clicks on submit ii) Website app generates a BTC top up address(m/44’/0’/0’/0/address_index) for the user and create a pending order record [insert into topup_order &lt;uuid,userid,btcaddress,btcindex,requestamt,exchangerate,createdate,status&gt;] iii) The user transfers BTC to the top up address assigned to him (he may transfer BTC from any exchanges or wallets as he like) iv) The scheduler service will periodically retrieve pending top-up requests from DB, and check transactions by RPC call to the BTC node, once detecting transactions to addresses that are in watchlist, update the user’s balance accordingly and update the record with txid/vout/scriptPub[update topup_order&lt;uuid,userid,btcaddress,btcindex,requestamt,exchangerate,createdate,status,realamt,txid,vout,scriptpub&gt;]. v) the scheduler service will then compose raw transaction based on realamt,txid,vout,scriptpub to transfer btc from users topup address(external account) to internal account, aggregate 40% of received BTC to a semi-cold wallet address(e.g m/44’/0’/1’/0/index), 60% of received BTC to a cold wallet(e.g m/44’/0’/2’/0/index)   2&gt; Withdraw Flow i) The user chooses to convert remained balance to BTC, key in 15000 CNY and provides a valid BTC address, the website app automatically displays 0.5 BTC based on the current exchange rate, the user confirms and submits withdraw request ii) Website app validates user’s balance and BTC address, and then creates a pending withdraw record[insert into withdraw_order &lt;uuid,userid,btcaddress,btcindex,balance,btcamt,exchangerate,createdate,status&gt;] iii) The scheduler service will periodically process all the pending withdraw request, transfer BTC from semi-cold wallet to the user’s BTC address   1.4 Tech spec   1&gt;

Recommended wallets are Decrediton or the Command-Line wallet. Your wallet will need time to sync itself to the latest block. This may take some time. It will do so automatically in the background.   3) Send your DCR to your wallet. Funds will show up if the wallet is synced to the latest block (sometimes a restart is required).   4) Pick a stakepool and sign up on the pool’s website. Copy the API key they will provide to you. A list of stakepools and their websites can be found at the bottom of the Decred website. They charge a small fee (5% or less) to be used. The pool API key can be found in the settings page on their website.   5) Go to the Tickets tab located within the Decredition wallet. Click Import Script and input your API key and password. Now you are connected to the pool.   6) Enter the number of tickets you would like to buy. The default transaction fee of 0.001 DCR is fine (it’s the minimum). The default Expiry of 16 blocks is fine too. Click Purchase. You will be asked to enter your password to complete the transaction. You should now see a ‘Success!’ message and the ticket hash.   7) Your ticket will enter the mempool and wait there to be mined.   8) After your ticket is mined it will go to immature status. You can see this in the Tickets tab. You will have to wait 256 blocks (about 21 hours) for your ticket to mature and go live. Once the ticket is live, you wait for your ticket to vote.   9) After a vote, your funds will need another 256 blocks to become spendable again. You receive the original ticket price plus the PoS reward of ~1.4 DCR minus the pool fee.   10) On average, live tickets vote within 28 days, but it can take as long as 142.22 days (40960 blocks) to vote. If a ticket does not vote within this window, it expires, and the ticket fee is lost (don’t worry, the cost price of the ticket is refunded). There is a chance of less than 0.5% that this will happen to you.   The estimated ROI is ~2% per ticket, depending on the ticket price and the PoS reward.   The importance of voting   The term vote is used because you will be voting on different proposals to change and improve Decred. It is the heart of the Decred governance model. You will notice there are Voting Preferences in the Tickets tab. This is where you can decide on your vote. Apart from voting, the PoS process is used to validate blocks from the PoW miners.   from https://www.decredible.com/how-to-stake-decred-beginners-guide/  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"I got an issue access the shared folder on the other pc in the same intranet at home, actually it was working fine a few days ago. both pc are win10 os.   without firm knowlege on networking I started to google without thinking, tried all the online suggestions but no luck;   ok, it could be something wrong either on my win10 or the other one, so I turned off firewall, started all the “file and printer sharing” realted services, turned on sharing for private/public network, grant remote access to both everyone and guest with full permissions,  even tried modify regedit(registry editor) to enable AllowInsecureGuestAuth, still no luck;   finally I come to think of ping, source ip:192.168.0.141, target ip:192.168.0.113, so ping 192.168.0.113 result in:  Pinging 192.168.0.113 with 32 bytes of data: Reply from *192.168.0.141*: Destination host unreachable.  the ip “Reply from “ is the source machine, it indicates that it’s something wrong with the source machine,  then I run ‘arp -a’,   now things get a bit clear, the target ip isn’t in the arp table, I tried arp -d to reset arp, but not working, so I decided the easiest way is to restart router to clear the arp table; after restarting router, all settled!   finally thoughts: I should spare some time to learn networking. refer: https://www.coursera.org/learn/network-protocols-architecture  ","categories": [],
