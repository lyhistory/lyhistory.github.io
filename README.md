Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

Code::

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```
